/**
 * Unit tests for the leaderboards (F13).
 *
 * ## What these are actually defending
 *
 * Three of the things under test are product guarantees rather than conveniences,
 * and the tests are written as attempts to break them:
 *
 *   `buildViewerBoard`   decides what one coach is shown. Its single most important
 *                        property is what it REFUSES to return: nobody below the
 *                        reader, ever, because that is the only thing standing
 *                        between the coach in last place and finding out. A change
 *                        that adds "and the person just behind you" would look like
 *                        a friendly touch and would break the whole feature.
 *
 *   `longestRunWithin`   is why a weekly board resets. If it ever measured the live
 *                        streak instead, one coach's 200-day run would win every
 *                        weekly board for the rest of their life.
 *
 *   the copy tables      carry the L4 line: a leaderboard is the easiest screen in
 *                        this app on which to write "₹" or "at this rate", so the
 *                        strings are asserted, not merely reviewed.
 *
 * Fixed dates only, never `Date.now()` — E1 exists because a day boundary has been
 * got wrong in this codebase before, and `currentPeriod` is exactly that question.
