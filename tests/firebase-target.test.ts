/**
 * The boot guard in `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts` — the single place this app decides
 * which project it talks to and with whose authority.
 *
 * It has never had a test, because it used to read `process.env` at module scope: a
 * unit test that imports it can only ever exercise the one configuration that process
 * was started with, and the interesting cases are the ones that must THROW. Splitting
 * the decision into a pure function of an env object is what makes the table below
 * possible, and the table is the point — every combination, stated once, including the
 * three that are refused.
 *
 * Why this matters more than its size suggests: the dangerous state is
 * FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST set on its own. The Admin SDK then swaps in the emulator
 * token verifier — `algorithms: ['none']` — so a session cookie signed with nothing,
 * naming any uid, is accepted, while Firestore reads and writes a REAL project. One
 * variable in a deploy config. Nothing in the logs says so.
