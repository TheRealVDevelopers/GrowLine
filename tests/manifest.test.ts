/**
 * The web app manifest (v1 §10).
 *
 * These are not style checks. Chrome will simply not offer installation if any of the
 * required fields is missing or wrong, and it says so nowhere a user would look — the
 * button is absent and that is the entire feedback. So the criteria are pinned here,
 * where a change that breaks installability fails a test instead of quietly removing a
 * feature nobody is watching.
 *
 * The audit that found the manifest missing found it by reading the filesystem, not by
 * anything failing. That is the gap this closes.
