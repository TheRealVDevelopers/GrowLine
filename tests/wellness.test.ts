/**
 * Unit tests for the wellness estimate engine and the report copy that surrounds it.
 *
 * ## What these tests are for
 *
 * Most of `src/lib/wellness.ts` is not a feature — it is a legal control surface.
 * CLAUDE.md Section 5.2 enumerates the six calculations this app may perform and
 * bans everything else; RULES.md L3 bans four specific English words from ever
 * describing a person; L6 bans reports for minors outright. Those are the lines
 * that carry consequences, so they are the lines with the most assertions below.
 *
 * ## How the expected values were arrived at, and why that matters
 *
 * Every number asserted here was computed from the published formula or from the
 * spec, by hand or by an independent reference implementation in this file — never
 * by running `computeWellness` and writing down what came back. A test built that
 * way is worse than no test: it passes forever, including for every bug already
 * present, and it converts a defect into a documented requirement. The reference
 * implementations below are therefore written in a DIFFERENT algebraic form from
 * the ones under test (textbook kg/m² against the module's kg·10000/cm², for
 * instance) so that agreement is evidence of correctness rather than evidence that
 * the same expression was typed twice.
 *
 * Two consequences of that discipline, both deliberate:
 *
 *  - One property below is marked `{ todo }`. It is a REAL failing assertion of a
 *    real inconsistency (the top of the healthy weight range does not band as
 *    healthy — see the test for the arithmetic). `todo` makes node:test run it and
 *    print the full diff on every CI run while keeping the suite's exit code at 0,
 *    so a known, reported, unfixed defect stays visible instead of being either
 *    silently deleted or blessed by an assertion that expects the wrong answer.
 *  - Where a constant is an implementation choice with no spec behind it (the
 *    granularity BMR is rounded to, the exact numeric plausibility cut-offs) the
 *    test asserts the PROPERTY the choice exists to deliver, not the constant.
 *
 * ## Why node:test and no new packages
 *
 * See tests/harness.test.ts. Nothing here needs jsdom or module mocking; both
 * modules under test are pure functions of their arguments.

     * `bmi < HEALTHY_BMI_MAX`. So the heaviest weight the card presents as

     * "Just above the general range".

     * Rounding to one decimal makes it unconditional rather than occasional:
     * anything in [22.95, 23) displays as 23.0 and is banded from the displayed
     * figure, so even heights where max lands slightly under 23 (165 cm → 62.6 kg
     * → true BMI 22.9936) still come out "just above". Checked at every height

     * above it is exactly the judgement-about-the-person that the neutral
     * phrasing exists to avoid.
     *
     * The fix is a product decision, not a test change — and note that simply
     * banding from the unrounded BMI would swap one inconsistency for another: at
     * 150 cm the published minimum of 41.6 kg is a true BMI of 18.4889, which is
     * genuinely BELOW 18.5 and only reads as healthy because the display rounds
     * it up. A range that round-trips at both ends has to be built from the
     * tenths the card can actually print — 22.9 × h² floored to a tenth at the
     * top, 18.5 × h² ceiled to a tenth at the bottom — rather than from the
     * endpoints of an open interval.
     *
     * FIXED. `healthyWeightRange` in src/lib/wellness.ts now searches for the extreme
     * printable tenths and verifies each against the same `bmiBand` the card uses, so
     * this is a live assertion rather than a recorded gap. Both ends moved: at 165 cm
     * the range went from 50.4–62.6 to 50.3–62.4, because the old lower bound was
