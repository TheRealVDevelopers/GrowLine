/**
 * `src/lib/day.ts` and `src/lib/daily-log.ts` — the timezone floor the whole app
 * stands on, and the streak maths that sits on top of it.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * RULES E1: "Never `new Date()` for a day boundary. IST is UTC+5:30; go through
 * `day.ts`. This has already broken roll-ups once." A rule written in the past tense
 * is a rule that was learned the expensive way, and D24/D26 record what it cost: a
 * server in UTC is 5.5 hours behind India, so every follow-up between 00:00 and
 * 05:30 IST landed on the wrong day, the morning reminder fired in the middle of the
 * night, and `unique(user_id, log_date)` split one Indian evening across two rows.
 * None of that is visible in a code review. It is only visible in a test that names
 * the instants either side of the boundary.
 *
 * ## How the expected values here were derived
 *
 * From the spec and from arithmetic, never by running the code and writing down what
 * it said. A test that copies current output cannot fail, which means it cannot
 * protect anything — it only makes a future bug look intentional. So:
 *
 *   - IST is UTC+05:30 by statute, and India observes no DST. Therefore IST midnight
 *     is 18:30 UTC on the previous calendar day, always, in every month of every
 *     year. Every instant below was chosen by hand from that one fact.
 *   - D24 states the boundary explicitly: "18:29Z is still 9 August in India while
 *     18:30Z is already the 10th". Those exact instants are asserted.
 *   - D27 states the streak rule ("anchors on today if today is logged, otherwise on
 *     yesterday") and the backfill cap (14 days).
 *   - v2 §4 dopamine map #1 states the Streak Shield: "one auto grace-day per month".
 *
 * Where a single expected value would under-state the intent, the assertion is a
 * PROPERTY instead — a day range is exactly 24 hours, `shiftKey` is invertible, a
 * streak is monotonic, `logDateFor` is idempotent. Properties survive refactors that
 * hardcoded values do not, and they say what the code is *for*.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT covered, and why
 *
 * The six-counter validation (negative / fractional / over-max / non-numeric) lives
 * in `src/app/api/logs/route.ts:43`, and the backfill gate lives in
 * `src/lib/daily-log-queries.ts:92`. Neither is importable from a unit test: both
 * modules reach `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts`, which calls `resolveTarget()` at module
 * scope (line 115) and throws unless a service account or an emulator pair is in the
 * environment. So this file asserts the pure arithmetic those gates depend on and
 * names the duplication; the gates themselves belong to the rules/e2e suites.

/**
 * These three are marked `todo` because the mechanic is NOT BUILT.
 *
 * v2 §4 dopamine map #1: "**Streak Shield:** one auto grace-day per month so a single
 * miss doesn't kill motivation … the shield absorbs it once." `src/lib/daily-log.ts`
 * has no allowance, no month bookkeeping and no grace day — `streakFromKeys` (line
 * 91) stops at the first key it does not find. `StreakFlame` accepts a `shieldUsed`
 * prop (StreakFlame.tsx:32,37) and renders copy for it (line 63), but nothing ever
 * passes it: `log/page.tsx:24` supplies only `days` and `live`, so the prop is dead
 * and the shield exists only as UI text for a state that cannot occur.
 *
 * They are written as `todo` rather than deleted, and rather than inverted into tests
 * that assert the current no-shield behaviour, on purpose. A passing test saying "one
 * miss ends the streak" would read as a decision, and the next person would treat it
 * as the spec. `node --test` runs these, reports them under `todo`, and exits 0 — so
 * CI stays green while the gap stays loud. Drop the `todo` flag when the mechanic
 * lands; the assertions are deliberately implementation-agnostic (they say "more than
 * the no-shield answer", not "exactly N"), so whatever shape the shield takes, these
 * should start passing without being rewritten to match it.
