/**
 * Duplication (F20).
 *
 * One number answering one question — is the work happening only at the top, or
 * genuinely three levels deep — and directly beneath it the per-level breakdown that
 * produced it. The pair is the feature: the number says whether there is a problem
 * and the breakdown says which level to ring tonight.
 *
 * ## A glance, not an interaction
 *
 * Nothing on this screen is operable. There is no filter, no switcher and no button,
 * so it ships no JavaScript beyond the count-up, loads in one server render, and
 * passes the 30-second rule by having nothing to operate (the boards screen makes
 * the same argument for the same reason).
 *
 * ## Zero data teaches, three different ways
 *
 * The three empty states are genuinely different and are worded as such: a coach
 * with no line has not started, a coach whose line all joined this week is waiting
 * for evidence, and a coach whose reading has never been computed is looking at a
 * scheduler that has not run. None of the three renders a zero — a zero is a verdict
 * on a line, and in all three cases there is no line to pass a verdict on yet.
 *
 * ## No money (L4)
 *
 * Counts of people and counts of days. Nothing on this page multiplies, converts,
 * projects or says "at this rate" — a duplication score beside a trajectory is an
 * income promise with the arithmetic left to the reader.
