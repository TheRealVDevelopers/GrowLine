/**
 * Nunito, for everything — Design System 3.2, chosen by the owner 2026-08-28.
 *
 * Rounded terminals and a wide, soft bowl: the friendliest widely-available face,
 * and the one that matches what this app is for. Its users are not accountants —
 * they are coaches whose day is conversations, and a geometric or technical face
 * makes a daily-log form feel like data entry. Nunito makes the same form feel
 * like a notebook.
 *
 * One family covering display and body, at 400 through 900. A single download
 * instead of a pair, which on a 3G connection outweighs the display/body pairing
 * the v2 spec argued for — and Nunito's 800/900 weights are distinct enough from
 * its 400 that the hierarchy survives without a second family.
 *
 * Both CSS variable names are kept and pointed here, so `font-display` and
 * `font-sans` resolve without touching a single component.
