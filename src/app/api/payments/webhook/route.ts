/**
 * Razorpay → Growline. The source of truth for every subscription state change.
 *
 * ## Unauthenticated on purpose, and gated by signature instead
 *
 * Razorpay has no Growline session. The proxy already skips `/api/*`, so this route is
 * reachable; what keeps it from being an open door is the HMAC over the RAW body with the
 * webhook secret, checked in constant time, BEFORE anything is parsed. A body that does
 * not verify is a 400 and nothing else happens.
 *
 * ## Read the raw text first
 *
 * `req.text()`, then verify, then `JSON.parse`. The signature is over the exact bytes
 * Razorpay sent, and `JSON.parse` + `JSON.stringify` does not round-trip byte-for-byte —
 * key order, whitespace and number formatting all move. Verifying a re-serialised body
 * would fail on every real event and pass on nothing.
 *
 * ## Always 200 once verified
 *
 * Razorpay retries anything that is not a 2xx, for days, with backoff. Once the signature
 * checks out we return 200 whatever `applySubscription` decides — a duplicate event, an
 * out-of-order event, an unknown subscription — because none of those is fixed by
 * Razorpay sending it again. Idempotency lives in `webhookEvents/{id}`, so a retry of an
 * event that DID apply is a no-op, not a second application.
