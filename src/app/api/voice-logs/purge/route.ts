 * Deletes voice notes that were never turned into numbers (session 4, feature 1).
 *
 * Called by a scheduler, never a browser — same guard and same shape as the other
 * scheduled work in these modules, so the logic stays in the app where it is runnable
 * by hand against the emulator and does not exist twice in two packages.
 *
 * A retention rule that arrives after the data does is a retention rule that has
 * already been broken once (the argument `purgeStaleHealthData` makes in
 * `functions/src/index.ts`), so this lands in the same change as the recorder.
