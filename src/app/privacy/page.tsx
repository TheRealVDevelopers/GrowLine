/**
 * The itemised privacy notice (v2 §5.4, DPDP Act 2023 + Rules 2025).
 *
 * ## Public, and that has to be tested
 *
 * A prospect reaches this from a QR form or a report page having never signed in, so it
 * is added to `PUBLIC_PATHS` in `src/proxy.ts`. Without that the proxy sends it to
 * `/login` — which is D68 exactly: a page that exists, renders, passes every unit test,
 * and is unreachable by the only people it was written for. There is a signed-out e2e
 * test for this.
 *
 * ## 404 until it is complete
 *
 * Four facts are not derivable from code — the legal entity, a named grievance officer,
 * their email, a postal address. Until all four are configured this route does not
 * exist. See `src/modules/privacy/model.ts` for why the alternative, a notice with gaps
 * in it, is worse than no notice.
 *
 * ## Everything else here is derived from the code, not aspirational
 *
 * Each retention figure is imported from the constant the job actually uses rather than
 * typed in. Where the app does something a reader would not expect — a report link being
 * a bearer credential, activity counts flowing up the tree even with sharing off — this
 * says so plainly. A notice that describes a nicer product than the one running is the
 * failure mode worth avoiding.
 *
 * ## Still outstanding: Kannada and Hindi
 *
 * v2 §5.4 requires this in English, Kannada and Hindi. Only English exists. Machine
 * translation of a legal document is not acceptable and D72 already forbids shipping
 * unverified translations, so the other two need a human. Recorded in STATUS.

          is not protected by a password.

      <Section title="What your coach’s upline can and cannot see">
        <p>
          Coaches work in teams. By default, a coach’s mentor sees <strong>numbers only</strong> —
          how many people were spoken to, invited or joined — and never your name or phone
          number.
        </p>
        <p>
          A coach can choose to share prospect details with their mentor. That setting is
          off unless they turn it on, and it is enforced by the database itself rather than
          only by the app. Activity counts flow upward either way; if you would rather a
          coach not hold your details at all, ask them to delete you or use the removal
          control on your report.
