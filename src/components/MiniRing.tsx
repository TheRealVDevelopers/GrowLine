/**
 * The target ring, small enough to sit inside a list row (delight plan, move 9).
 *
 * ## Why the home screen needs a ring at all
 *
 * The full `TargetRing` lives on /targets — a screen a coach visits deliberately.
 * Home is the screen they open without deciding to, and v2 §4's mechanic #2 is
 * about the tension an unfinished arc creates (the Zeigarnik effect): a shape with
 * a gap in it asks to be closed, where a number simply reports. Putting a small
 * one on the first screen of the day is the whole point of the mechanic; leaving
 * it only on the screen you go to when you already care is not.
 *
 * ## Deliberately a separate component, not a `size` prop on TargetRing
 *
 * TargetRing carries the celebration: a localStorage read, milestone detection,
 * the confetti call, the glow, a dismiss handler. None of that belongs on a card
 * a coach scrolls past — a celebration that fires in a list row while they are
 * reaching for something else is noise, and worse, it would consume the crossing
 * so the real ring never celebrates it. This renders the same geometry and
 * nothing else. It is a server component for the same reason: no state, no
 * effects, nothing to hydrate.
 *
 * The REMAINING arc is drawn, matching TargetRing exactly. If that ever changes
 * there, it must change here — two rings on two screens disagreeing about which
 * part of the circle is the story would be worse than having no ring on home.
