/**
 * Firestore shapes and document ids for the two qualification collections.
 *
 * ## Two collections, and the split is the privacy line
 *
 *   qualifications        the DEFINITION: who made it, what it is called, the
 *                         conditions, the closing date. Readable by the creator and
 *                         by the coaches it applies to — it is an announcement, and
 *                         a condition nobody can read is not a condition.
 *
 *   qualificationProgress everybody's NUMBERS, plus the roll-up over them. Denied to
 *                         every client, always.
 *
 * The split is deliberate and mirrors N7's podium/roster split for the same reason.
 * If the counts lived on the definition document, "readable by the audience" would
 * hand every participant the audience size, every other coach's shortfall, and the
 * full distribution — and the honest qualifier list this module renders would be a
 * courtesy rather than a guarantee. The screens read the numbers server-side with the
 * Admin SDK and hand the browser only what that reader is entitled to.
 *
 * ## Two kinds in the progress collection
 *
 * `progress` (one per participant) and `summary` (one per qualification), separated
 * by a `kind` field — the same arrangement as N7, and for the same reason: this
 * branch may create `qualificationProgress` and nothing else, so the roll-up lives
 * beside the rows it rolls up.
 *
 * Document ids are deterministic and live in `ids.ts` — kept out of this file so a
 * unit test can import them without booting firebase-admin.
