/**
 * Working out where everybody stands. Server only, never a browser.
 *
 * ## Why this is a job rather than a page calculation
 *
 * A qualification's numbers are an aggregation across a whole line: prospects, logs,
 * targets and proofs for every participant. Doing that per screen open, per coach, on
 * a ₹10K Android's connection is the shape leaderboards' compute.ts exists to avoid.
 * This runs once and writes one small document per participant; the screens read
 * those.
 *
 * It is called from three places: once synchronously when a qualification is created
 * (so the tracker is populated the moment it exists rather than after the next
 * scheduled run), by the scheduled evaluator, and by a page whose stored numbers have
 * gone stale (`ensureFresh`).
 *
 * ## The audience is resolved LIVE, every time
 *
 * D64's rule. No participant list is stored: membership is recomputed from the
 * CURRENT user documents on each run. A coach who joins the line mid-qualification is
 * in it from that moment, and a coach who moves out stops being in it — including
 * having their progress row deleted, for N6a's reason. Leaving the row behind would
 * keep somebody who is no longer in this line on a qualifier list their old upline's
 * team is reading.
 *
 * ## Prospect identity never enters this file
 *
 * People met is a COUNT. No prospect name, phone or health field is read, stored or
 * rolled up here — P1's line, and it holds sideways as well as upward, because a
 * qualifier list is read by peers.

/**
 * How long a closed qualification keeps being re-evaluated.
 *
 * Not zero, and the reason is proof approval. A coach whose last piece of work lands
 * on the deadline needs an upline to approve it, and that happens when the upline
 * next opens the app — often the following week. Stopping the moment the window
 * closes would mean the work counted for nothing because somebody else was slow.
 *
 * For the four WINDOWED criteria the intent holds exactly: only the checking arrives
 * late, because every underlying row carries a time and the day-key bounds refuse
 * anything outside the window.
 *
 * For VOLUME it does not, and an audit corrected an earlier claim here that said it
 * did. `progressPoints` is one self-typed running total per month with no per-point
 * history (N4, N14), so what the bounds select is which MONTHS are read, never when
 * a point inside one was entered. Two consequences, both real and neither fixable
 * from this module:
 *
 *   late entry    points typed into a window month AFTER the deadline count, for as
 *                 long as this late-checking period runs. Usually that is a coach
 *                 catching up on paperwork, which is the behaviour we want; it is
 *                 also the one an upline would have to approve to make it pay.
 *
 *   back-fill     the baseline records what a coach had TYPED when they entered, not
 *                 what they had EARNED. A coach who logs the month's points in one go
 *                 afterwards has the whole month credited to the qualification.
 *
 * The fix for both is a per-point or per-approval record — `progressPointsAtReview`
 * on the proof, in `src/lib/targets-queries.ts`, an existing file this branch may not
 * touch. Reported, not done. See N14a.
