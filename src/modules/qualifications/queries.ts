/**
 * The read side: stored rows in, one reader's view out. Server only.
 *
 * ## Who may see what
 *
 * Three positions, and they are decided here from the CURRENT user document rather
 * than from anything stored on a qualification (D64):
 *
 *   creator      sees the dashboard: counts, per-criterion drop-off, and the names of
 *                the coaches who are one condition away. Every one of those people is
 *                in their own line, so the counts already flow to them (P1) and the
 *                team tree already shows them coach by coach.
 *
 *   participant  sees their own tracker in full, the NAMES of everyone who has
 *                qualified, and a COUNT of how many are one condition away — never
 *                the names of that second group. Being in is good news and an event
 *                list is public by nature; being nearly-in is somebody's shortfall,
 *                and publishing a named list of shortfalls to their peers is the
 *                leaderboard leak N2 exists to prevent, wearing different clothes.
 *
 *   anybody else "Not found" — the same answer as a qualification that does not
 *                exist, so no route here can be used to discover what an upline in
 *                another line is running (the discipline targets-queries.ts uses).
 *
 * No prospect name, phone or health field is read anywhere in this file. The only
 * personal data that moves is a COACH's own name, to people already in their line.
