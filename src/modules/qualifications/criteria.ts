/**
 * The criterion registry — the data model this feature is actually about (F14).
 *
 * ## The shape, and why it is a LIST of typed pairs
 *
 * A qualification is `{ criteria: [{ type, target }, …] }`: an array of
 * `Criterion`, each naming one entry in the table below and the number that clears
 * it. Any combination, in any order, each with its own target.
 *
 * The obvious alternative — five nullable fields on the qualification document
 * (`volumeTarget`, `membersTarget`, …) — was rejected before anything was written,
 * because of what the sixth criterion costs under each:
 *
 *   five fields          a schema change, a migration, a new branch in the evaluator,
 *                        a new branch in every progress renderer, a new key in the
 *                        summary map, and a rules change if the field is validated.
 *   a list of pairs      one entry in CRITERION_SPECS and one case in the collector.
 *                        Nothing that iterates `criteria` has to be edited at all —
 *                        the tracker, the nudge, the qualifier list, the drop-off
 *                        table and the reminder copy all loop over what is there.
 *
 * That is the whole design. Everything downstream is written as a loop over
 * `criteria` and a lookup in this table, never as five named branches, and the unit
 * suite asserts that a criterion type added here needs no other file to change.
 *
 * ## Two ways a number can be measured, and why the distinction is in the table
 *
 *   windowed     the underlying rows are stamped with a time, so the value IS a count
 *                inside the window: prospects captured, members added, coaches
 *                recruited, days logged. Nothing needs remembering.
 *
 *   cumulative   only a running total exists. Volume is a monthly cumulative figure
 *                by construction (F7, D30) with no per-day history — N4 records that
 *                same limitation on the boards. Counting the month's whole figure
 *                would credit a coach for points earned before the qualification was
 *                announced, which is padding of exactly the kind the brief forbids.
 *                So a cumulative criterion is measured against a BASELINE captured
 *                when the coach enters the qualification, and progress is the
 *                difference.
 *
 * A future criterion declares which it is and the evaluator does the rest.
 *
 * ## RULES L4 — there is no money in this file and there must never be
 *
 * Every unit here is a count: points, people, coaches, days. A qualification is the
 * second-easiest screen in this app on which to write "₹" or "at this rate you
 * would…", after a leaderboard. The copy therefore lives in this table and is
 * asserted by tests/qualifications.test.ts rather than reviewed by eye.
 *
 * PURE ONLY — no database import. The create form is a client component (E2).
