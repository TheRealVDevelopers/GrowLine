/**
 * The privacy notice's publication gate (v2 §5.4).
 *
 * ## Why a notice can be missing but must never be half-written
 *
 * DPDP Rules 2025 require a notice to name the entity that holds the data, a grievance
 * officer a person can actually reach, and a postal address. None of those is derivable
 * from code — they are facts about a company. Everything else in the notice IS derivable,
 * and is written.
 *
 * So the page has two states and no third: fully published, or absent. If any required
 * fact is missing the route 404s, exactly as the admin panel and demo mode do when their
 * configuration is absent. A notice that says "grievance officer: TBD" is worse than no
 * notice at all — it is a document that looks like a legal commitment while failing the
 * one duty it exists to discharge, and it is the kind of thing that gets screenshotted.
 *
 * The day those four values are set, the notice and every link to it appear together.
 *
 * PURE ONLY — no database (RULES E2). The page is a server component but the gate is
 * also read by the layout to decide whether to render links.

 * The retention window the notice has to state as a number.
 *
 * RE-EXPORTED, not restated. The first draft wrote `= 180` as a fresh literal under a
 * comment claiming it was stated once, which would have made the notice a third
 * independent copy — and the copy that goes stale silently, because nothing else in the
 * suite compares a legal document to a purge job.
 *
 * `functions/src/index.ts` keeps its own `RETENTION_DAYS = 180` because Cloud Functions
 * are a separate package that cannot import from `src/`. That duplication is pre-existing
 * and pinned by the retention tests; this does not add a fourth.
 *
 * The report-link window is NOT re-exported here, deliberately. `@/lib/report` reaches
 * the Firestore admin client transitively, and pulling that into this module would make
 * the publication gate unimportable from anything a client component touches (RULES E2) —
 * the first attempt did exactly that and the unit suite failed on the admin boot guard.
 * The page is a server component and imports `REPORT_TTL_DAYS` straight from the source.
