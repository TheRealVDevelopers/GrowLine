/**
 * Payments (v2 §8, Phase 9b) — Razorpay Subscriptions for the Leader tier.
 *
 * ## What this module is, and what it refuses to be
 *
 * It turns a Razorpay subscription's lifecycle into ONE fact the rest of the app reads:
 * whether a coach is a paying Leader today. Everything else — card numbers, UPI handles,
 * bank details, the mandate itself — lives with Razorpay and never touches this codebase.
 * RULES L7 is not a guideline here; it is the shape of the data model. There is no field
 * in which a credential could be stored.
 *
 * ## The two things this must get right, and why they are hard
 *
 * **Idempotency.** Razorpay retries webhooks, sometimes for days, and delivers them out
 * of order. Every event carries a stable id, and processing is keyed on it: the same
 * event twice is one state change, and an `activated` arriving after a `cancelled` does
 * not resurrect a subscription somebody ended.
 *
 * **Never lock a user out of their business.** v2 §8: on cancel or failure, team features
 * freeze and everything individual continues. That is already how tiers work — the tier
 * is DERIVED from this record at read time (`effectiveTier`), so downgrade means the
 * derivation changes and not one document is deleted.
 *
 * ## The Trust Zone (RULES G1)
 *
 * Every screen this feeds is a money screen: flat, calm, no glow, no celebration, plain
 * language. The copy constants at the bottom of this file are the entire vocabulary those
 * screens may use for money, and the unit suite sweeps them.
 *
 * PURE ONLY — no database, no Razorpay SDK, no crypto (RULES E2; the checkout button and
 * the cancel flow are client components).
