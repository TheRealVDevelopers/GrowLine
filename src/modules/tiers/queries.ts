 * Server side of tiers (v2 §8).

 * ## One document per coach, absent means Starter
 *
 *   tiers/{userId}   tier, source, trialEndsKey, offerSeenKey
 *
 * Absence being a valid state is the point: Starter is free forever and needs no row,
 * so the collection only ever holds the coaches who moved — trials, grants, and later
 * paid Leaders. Every read of a missing doc is a coach on Starter, not an error.
 *
 * ## No Security Rules block, deliberately
 *
 * Same shape as `portfolios` (see that file's note): every read goes through the admin
 * SDK in a server component or API route, no browser queries this collection, so the
 * default catch-all deny in firestore.rules is both the safest rule and the correct
 * one. A tier a client could write itself would be a price a client sets itself.
