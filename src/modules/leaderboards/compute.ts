/**
 * Building the board snapshots. Runs on a schedule, on the server, never in a browser.
 *
 * ## Why a snapshot at all
 *
 * A board is an aggregation across an entire organisation. Firestore has no group-by,
 * so a client-side board would be "read every log in the company and add them up",
 * once per coach, per screen open, on a ₹10K Android. This job does it once per run
 * for everybody, and the screen then reads two documents.
 *
 * ## What is counted, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * Counts only — people, follow-ups, days, points (RULES L4). No money appears in this
 * file, and nothing here derives a rate, a projection or a conversion.
 *
 * Prospect IDENTITY never leaves this function. The rows carry a coach's own name and
 * a number; the people they met are counted, never named. That is the P1 line: counts
 * flow, names do not — and here they do not flow even to the coach's own upline,
 * because a board is read sideways by peers as well as upward.
 *
 * ## Opt-outs are applied before ranking
 *
 * A coach who has opted out is removed from the rows, not hidden from the render. If
 * they were filtered later the ranks would have holes in them, and a hole is an
 * observation about the person missing from it.
