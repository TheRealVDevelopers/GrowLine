/**
 * Document shapes and ids for `leaderboardSnapshots`.
 *
 * ## Three kinds of document in one collection, and why
 *
 * This module is allowed exactly one new collection for boards, so the three things
 * it must store live in it side by side, separated by a `kind` field:
 *
 *   podium  the top 3 of one board, plus what board it is. Readable by a client that
 *           belongs to the scope — the Security Rule proves membership.
 *   roster  the FULL ranked list and the participant count. Denied to every client,
 *           deliberately: it is the bottom-to-the-top ordering the brief forbids
 *           anyone from seeing, and the server slices each coach's upward-only
 *           window out of it (see ranking.ts).
 *   optOut  one per coach who has asked not to be listed.
 *
 * Splitting podium from roster is not tidiness. If a single document carried both,
 * "readable by members of the scope" would hand every member the whole ordering,
 * and the no-last-place guarantee would hold only in the UI — which is exactly the
 * "the UI hiding it proves nothing" failure that RULES P2 exists to stop.
 *
 * ## Why the opt-out flag lives here
 *
 * It belongs on the user document and cannot go there: this branch may not write to
 * an existing collection. So it is a document in this one, keyed by uid. The costs,
 * accepted knowingly:
 *
 *   - the compute job reads every opt-out document each run (one `kind` query),
 *     rather than getting the flag free with the user it already loaded;
 *   - a deleted user leaves an orphan. It fails safe — an orphan means "not listed";
 *   - nothing else in the app can see the flag, so a future Settings screen has to
 *     read this collection rather than the user's own document.
 *
 * When a session is allowed to touch `users`, this becomes a boolean there and the
 * migration is one script.
 *
 * ## Ids are deterministic
 *
 * Same reasoning as D35: a rerun of the compute job must overwrite the board it
 * wrote last hour, not add a second copy of it. `scopeKey` can be free text (a level
 * name, a city) so it is hashed into the id and stored in full in the document.
