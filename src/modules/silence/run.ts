/**
 * The scheduled silence run (session 4, feature 3).
 *
 * Reads the whole organisation once, builds every upline's legs in memory, and sends at
 * most two notifications per upline. Server only.
 *
 * ## Two queries, not one per leg
 *
 * The naive shape — for each upline, for each leg, query that leg's logs — is a query
 * count that grows with the square of the organisation, which is exactly the shape the
 * team tree was rewritten to avoid (D36). Instead: all users once, all recent logs once,
 * and the leg structure assembled from `uplinePath`, which already names every ancestor
 * of every coach.
 *
 * ## Counts only, never identity (P1)
 *
 * Nothing in this file touches `prospects`. What crosses from a downline to an upline is
 * a name they already see in their own team tree, a number of people, and a number of
 * days — which is precisely what v1 §5.4 allows to flow upward. There is no code path
 * here that could carry a prospect's name even by accident, because no prospect is ever
 * read.
 *
 * ## Live ancestry, never a stored snapshot (D64)
 *
 * Legs are rebuilt from the CURRENT `users` documents on every run. Nothing is trusted
 * off the stored alert row except what was already said and when — a coach moved to
 * another line stops appearing in their old upline's legs on the next run, with nothing
 * to migrate and no frozen path to go stale.
