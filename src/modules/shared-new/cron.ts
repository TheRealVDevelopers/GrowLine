/**
 * The guard on every scheduler-called route in these modules.
 *
 * One copy, used by every scheduler-called route. `/api/leaderboards/rebuild` and
 * `/api/notifications/daily` each carried their own inline duplicate — this file's
 * original note said a check living in three places is a check that will be fixed in
 * two of them, and then left the other two alone because they belonged to merged work.
 * They were folded in on 2026-08-19, so there is now exactly one implementation.
 *
 * NOT the same thing as the Razorpay webhook's signature check, which compares an HMAC
 * with `node:crypto`'s `timingSafeEqual` over buffers. That one verifies a signature
 * over a body; this one compares a shared secret. Merging them would be a coincidence of
 * shape, not of purpose.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED with no secret configured. These endpoints are not a data leak, but
 * each one makes the server read a large slice of the organisation on demand, as
 * often as anybody likes.
