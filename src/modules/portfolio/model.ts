/**
 * The public portfolio (v1 §F9) — the page a prospect lands on from a wellness report.
 *
 * ## What this page is for
 *
 * It is the coach's first impression, and it is the only screen in Growline a prospect
 * ever sees on purpose. F3 calls the report a marketing asset; this is the other half of
 * it. A prospect who reads their numbers and wants to know who sent them arrives here.
 *
 * ## Why the slug is claimed the way a referral code is
 *
 * The URL gets printed. It rides on every report, it goes on a QR poster on a club wall,
 * and coaches read it out loud. That makes it the one identifier in the app that cannot
 * be reassigned later without breaking paper — so it is claimed transactionally through a
 * reservation document, the same shape D41 established for referral codes, and it is
 * never silently changed underneath somebody.
 *
 * ## PURE ONLY — no database import
 *
 * The editor is a client component (RULES E2).
