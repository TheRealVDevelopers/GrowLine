/**
 * The Firestore shape for `duplicationScores`, and the id that keys it.
 *
 * ## One document per coach, and no history
 *
 * The id is `dup_<uid>`: deterministic, for D35's reason and N7's — a scheduled job
 * that reruns must OVERWRITE the reading it wrote three hours ago, not leave a
 * second copy of it beside the first. A query returning two readings for one coach
 * is a bug that only shows up as a number flickering between two values.
 *
 * No trend is stored, and that is deliberate rather than an omission. The window is
 * 28 days and rolls one day at a time, so a day-on-day delta is mostly noise; a
 * meaningful "up 12 since last month" needs a stored series and a sampling interval
 * chosen on purpose, and inventing one to put an arrow on the card would be
 * decoration without behaviour (G6). It is the obvious next thing to build, with a
 * second `kind` of document in this collection holding monthly samples.
 *
 * ## What is NOT in here
 *
 * No names. Not one. The document holds counts of people per level and nothing that
 * identifies any of them — which is what lets a line's activity be summarised at all
 * under P1 (counts flow up the line, identities do not). If a future screen wants
 * "which four people at level 2 have gone quiet", that is a different document with
 * a different rule, and it has to answer the privacy question from scratch.
 *
 * No money, no rate of change, no projection (L4).
