/**
 * Building every coach's duplication reading. Runs on a schedule, on the server.
 *
 * ## Why this is a scheduled job and not a page query
 *
 * A coach's score depends on everybody up to three levels below them, and on every
 * day those people logged in the last four weeks. Computed on page load that is a
 * whole-line read per open, on a ₹10K Android, for a number that moves by fractions
 * of a percent between one morning and the next. Computed here it is two collection
 * reads for the entire organisation, however many coaches then look at it.
 *
 * The consequence is that the number on the screen is as old as the last run, so the
 * screen SAYS how old it is — the same honesty N21a settled for the qualification
 * list. A reading presented as this minute's, that is actually Tuesday's, is worse
 * than a reading labelled Tuesday.
 *
 * ## What is here and what is in line.ts
 *
 * This file reads documents and writes documents. Everything that decides what they
 * MEAN — the window's two ends, how much of it a person has been present for, and
 * which coach's line each person belongs to at which depth — lives in `line.ts`,
 * which imports no database and is therefore testable against hand-worked examples.
 * Two collection reads happen here, whatever the size of the organisation.
 *
 * ## No names, no money
 *
 * Nothing written by this job identifies a person. Levels are counts of people, and
 * a count is what P1 lets flow up a line. Not one figure here is money, a rate of
 * change, or a projection (L4).

     * it belongs to. The case that empties a line is most often the line moving —

     * find out. It costs one write per lineless coach per run. If that ever needs
     * cutting, cut it by reading which readings exist — never by going back to a
     * silent skip.
