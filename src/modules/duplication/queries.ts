/**
 * The read side. Server only — the page is rendered on the server and the browser is
 * handed the finished view, exactly as the boards and the qualification screens are.
 *
 * ## One coach, their own reading, and nothing else
 *
 * `getDuplicationFor` reads the CALLER'S OWN document and takes no id from anywhere.
 * There is no authorization decision in this file because there is no request that
 * could name somebody else's reading — which is the cheapest way to be sure of one.
 *
 * A screen showing an upline a downline's reading is a real and obvious next feature,
 * and it does not belong here as a parameter with a check bolted on. It has to decide
 * membership against the CURRENT tree (D64 — never a `uplinePath` frozen at write
 * time; every reading in this collection carries one from whenever the job last ran)
 * and it has to answer for itself whether a per-level breakdown of somebody's team is
 * a count that flows up under P1 or a judgement that should not. Neither question is
 * answered by widening a function that currently cannot get it wrong.
 *
 * ## Nothing is recomputed on open
 *
 * Unlike a qualification tracker (N21), which refreshes one qualification when it
 * goes stale, this reading is the aggregation of an entire organisation. Refreshing
 * it on open would mean a coach's page load costs a whole-tree read, which is the
 * exact expense the scheduled job exists to pay once. So the view carries
 * `generatedAt` and the screen states it plainly.
