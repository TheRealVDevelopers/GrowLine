/**
 * The duplication score (F20) — the maths, and nothing else.
 *
 * PURE. No Firestore, no Node built-ins, no `new Date()` (E1, E2). Everything here
 * takes day counts that somebody else worked out in the coach's own timezone, so this
 * file can be unit-tested against hand-worked examples and imported by a client
 * component without dragging firebase-admin into the browser bundle.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE QUESTION
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * One number, answering one thing: **is the work happening only at the top, or
 * genuinely three levels deep?**
 *
 * It is built from the SHARE OF ACTIVE LOGGERS AT EACH DEPTH of a line, over a
 * rolling window, and it is deliberately not built from anything else. The
 * per-depth breakdown that produced it is stored beside it and rendered with it —
 * a score with no breakdown is a number nobody can act on, and this feature exists
 * to be acted on.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE FORMULA
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * For each depth d below the coach (d = 1, 2, 3):
 *
 *     n_d  people at that depth who have been in the line long enough to count
 *     k_d  how many of those are ACTIVE (see "Active", below)
 *
 * The line's own pooled rate, across every depth:
 *
 *     m = (Σ k_d) / (Σ n_d)
 *
 * Each depth's rate is then SHRUNK toward that pooled rate by a pseudo-count α:
 *
 *     â_d = (k_d + α·m) / (n_d + α)                          α = SHRINKAGE = 2
 *
 * And the score is the depth-weighted mean of those, over the depths that EXIST:
 *
 *     score = 100 · ( Σ d·â_d ) / ( Σ d )      over every d where n_d > 0
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the weight is the depth itself
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Activity at level 1 can be explained by the coach personally chasing every one of
 * their direct downlines. Activity at level 3 cannot — those are people the coach
 * has very likely never rung. So the deeper the level, the more it counts, in the
 * simplest ratio that says so: level 3 activity is worth three times level 1
 * activity. A top-heavy line and a bottom-heavy line with the same overall activity
 * therefore do NOT score the same, which is the entire point of the number.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the shrinkage, and what makes 70 mean the same for a line of 6 and of 600
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Four things, in order of how much work they do:
 *
 * 1. **Every input is a RATE, never a count.** A line of 600 has more active loggers
 *    than a line of 6 by construction, so any score built on counts would just be a
 *    size ranking wearing a different name.
 *
 * 2. **The divisor is the depths that exist, not the people.** Σd over the present
 *    depths is 1, 3 or 6 — it never touches line size, so one enormous level 1
 *    cannot drown out a small level 3, and a small line is not scored against a
 *    denominator built for a big one.
 *
 * 3. **Shrinkage makes the middle of the range reachable at small sizes.** Without
 *    it a level of one person has a rate of exactly 0 or exactly 100 and nothing in
 *    between, so a small line's score would be assembled from extremes and "70"
 *    would be a number only a big line could ever land on. Pulling each depth toward
 *    the line's OWN pooled rate says the honest thing: one person having a bad month
 *    is not evidence that a level has stopped duplicating.
 *
 * 4. **The exact invariant.** If every depth has the same rate r, then m = r and
 *    every â_d = r identically — so the score is exactly 100r, at any line size and
 *    any number of depths. A line that is uniformly half active scores 50 whether it
 *    holds 6 people or 600. That is the guarantee, and it is what "the same thing"
 *    means here.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT promise: that two lines with the same per-depth
 * rates but different sizes score identically when those rates DIFFER between
 * depths. They converge as the line grows — a big line's structure is trusted, a
 * small one's is pulled toward its own average. Promising exact equality there would
 * mean trusting one person out of one as much as two hundred out of two hundred,
 * which is how a score of 100 gets handed to a line where a single coach logged once.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A line that is only one level deep
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * It is scored on the levels it HAS. A coach with four direct downlines who are all
 * logging scores 100, and that is not a bug: of the line that exists, all of it is
 * working. The alternative — capping the score by depth reached, so one level can
 * never beat 33 — was considered and rejected outright. It would tell a coach in
 * their first month that they have failed at something they have not had the chance
 * to start, which is exactly the reading this number must never produce.
 *
 * The depth a line actually reaches is reported SEPARATELY and prominently
 * (`deepestLevel`), because that is real information — it just is not a judgement.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three levels, not the whole ancestry
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `uplinePath` (D36) carries every ancestor, so measuring ten levels down would cost
 * nothing extra. We measure exactly THREE, for two reasons:
 *
 *   - v1 §11 caps the team tree at three levels, so level 4 is people the coach
 *     cannot see on any screen in this app. A number that moves because of people a
 *     coach cannot look up is a number they cannot act on.
 *   - the question is literally "is it three levels deep". Level 4 activity is
 *     already counted — in the score belonging to the coach it sits three levels
 *     under. Every coach's own line is measured once, by them.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * No money, ever (RULES L4)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Every quantity in this file is a count of people or a count of days. Nothing is
 * multiplied by a rupee figure, converted, extrapolated or projected forward. There
 * is no "at this rate" anywhere, and there must never be: a duplication score sitting
 * next to a growth curve is an income projection with the arithmetic left to the
 * reader.
