/**
 * Collection names and document-id construction.
 *
 * ## Why the ids look like this
 *
 * Firestore has no unique constraints. The Prisma schema had SIX, and every one of
 * them protects a correctness property somebody already reasoned through:
 *
 *   unique(coachId, clientId)      D6  — a retried offline sync must not create
 *                                        the same person twice
 *   unique(prospectId, inputsHash) D20 — two concurrent renders must not mint two
 *                                        live 90-day bearer tokens to one person's
 *                                        health data
 *   unique(userId, logDate)        D26 — one log per coach per day *in their own
 *                                        timezone*
 *   unique(coachId, month)             — one target per coach per month
 *   unique(pushSubscriptions.endpoint) — one row per device, or it is notified twice
 *   unique(users.referralCode)     D41 — two coaches sharing a code means one of
 *                                        them silently receives the other's QR
 *                                        captures and downlines
 *
 * The only mechanism Firestore offers that is equally strong is the document id
 * itself: a `set()` on a deterministic id is an upsert, and two racing writers
 * converge on one document instead of creating two. So each constraint becomes an
 * id. Do not replace these with auto-ids and a query — the query is not atomic and
 * the constraint quietly stops existing.
 *
 * `referralCode` is the one that cannot be the owning document's id, because the
 * user document is already keyed by the Auth uid (D34). It gets a RESERVATION
 * document instead — `referralCodes/{CODE}` — created in the same transaction as the
 * user, so the create fails if the code is taken. See D41.
 *
 * Two more from the Prisma schema resolve without work here:
 *   users.phone      — Firebase Auth's Phone provider allows one account per number,
 *                      and the user doc id IS that account's uid, so a duplicate
 *                      would need two Auth accounts on one number. Auth prevents it.
 *   reports.token    — 26 chars over a 33-char alphabet (~131 bits) from a CSPRNG.
 *                      A reservation collection here would cost a write on every
 *                      report to defend against a collision far rarer than silent
 *                      disk corruption. Deliberately not defended; see D41.

 * costs exactly one document however many thousand people it reaches.
 *
 * The alternative — writing the recipient list onto the thread — breaks on the two
 * things that actually happen: a line of a few thousand exceeds what belongs in one
 * document, and anyone who joins after the send would never see it.
 *
