 * Threads — one-way broadcasts down a line (F8, v2 §6).
 *
 * ## What this feature is, and what it deliberately is not
 *
 * An upline writes one message and their line receives it. A downline can tap
 * acknowledge, and the sender watches that count rise. Any coach can re-broadcast
 * something they received to THEIR own line, which is how one message cascades
 * through thousands of people while every sender only ever writes to their own.
 *
 * It is NOT a chat. v1 §5.5 and RULES S3 forbid group chat outright, and the reason
 * is not squeamishness: two-way team chatter needs moderation, creates noise nobody
 * can catch up on, and WhatsApp already exists for it. So there is no reply, no
 * reaction, no mention, and no field on the document that could grow into one. The
 * only response a downline can make is "I saw this", and it is a number.
 *
 * PURE ONLY — no database import. `ThreadComposer` and `ThreadFeed` are client
 * components, and E2 exists because importing a queries module into a client file
 * pulls a server driver into the browser bundle.

 * ~1223, and four-byte characters push that multiplier to roughly six.
