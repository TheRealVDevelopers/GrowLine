/**
 * Every word that appears on a wellness report lives here.
 *
 * This file is the compliance surface. Nothing on a report may be typed by a
 * coach at runtime and nothing may be generated per-prospect: free text on the
 * report cannot be reviewed, so it cannot be compliant. If you are adding a
 * string to a report, add it here.
 *
 * Two rules that are easy to break by accident:
 *  1. The next-step line is chosen INDEPENDENTLY of the person's numbers.
 *     Copy that changes with a health estimate is advice-by-algorithm.
 *  2. No clinical category word ever describes the person. Labels say where the
 *     NUMBER sits. "Obesity" in particular is a scheduled condition under the
 *     Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act 1954, and F3
 *     calls this report a marketing asset — so naming it is a legal problem.
