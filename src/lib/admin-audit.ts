/**
 * Every admin action that changes anything, recorded (F12).
 *
 * The panel is read-only almost everywhere, which is what makes this cheap: there are
 * only a handful of writes, so logging all of them is a few lines rather than a framework.
 *
 * ## Why it records the actor's name as well as their id
 *
 * A uid is unreadable six months later, and the user document it points at can change or —
 * once accounts can be closed — stop existing. An audit entry has to stay legible without
 * a join to anything, so it carries the name as it was at the time. Same reasoning as the
 * denormalised `senderName` on threads.
 *
 * ## Denied to clients, including admins
 *
 * `firestore.rules` refuses this collection to every browser. An audit trail the audited
 * party can read is one they can learn to work around. The panel renders it server-side.
