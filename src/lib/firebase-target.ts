/**
 * Which project this process talks to — decided once, at import.
 *
 * The Admin SDK resolves emulator routing per product, from two independent
 * variables: Firestore reads FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST, Auth reads
 * FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST. Set one without the other and half of this app talks
 * to a real project. The auth-only half is the dangerous half: with
 * FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST set, `verifyIdToken` and `verifySessionCookie` stop
 * checking the signature and merely decode — `token-verifier.js` swaps in the
 * emulator verifier, which is `verifyJwtSignature(token, undefined, { algorithms:
 * ['none'] })`, and stops requiring `kid` and RS256 at the same time. So a cookie
 * signed with nothing, naming any uid, is accepted against real data, and nothing in
 * the logs says so.
 *
 * `usingEmulators` used to read FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST alone, which made exactly
 * that state invisible: it stayed false, so the missing-credential check below was
 * satisfied by a real service account while every token went unverified. One
 * variable in a deploy config, and everything looked correct. Hence a guard rather
 * than a paragraph in .env.example.
 *
 * Three configurations boot, and no others:
 *   - both emulator hosts set, FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT unset — dev, e2e, CI
 *   - both emulator hosts unset, FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT set — a real project
 *   - none of the three set, but running on Cloud Run — App Hosting, using the
 *     credential the platform already attached (D80). This is the only branch where
 *     no key material exists anywhere, which is why it is the preferred one in
 *     production and why `apphosting.yaml` needs no secret at all.
 *
 * NODE_ENV takes no part, deliberately. `next build` then `next start` against the
 * emulators is how the production bundle gets checked before it ships, so
 * NODE_ENV=production is not evidence of a real deployment, and gating on it would
 * break that check. A service account is the honest signal of intent — it exists
 * only to reach a real project — which is why one alongside an emulator host is an
 * error rather than a precedence rule to pick.
 *
 * Presence is plain truthiness because that is the test the SDK itself applies:
 * `useEmulator()` in `auth-api-request.js` is `!!process.env.FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST`,
 * so `FOO=""` is unset to both — which is why .env.example's empty credential line is
 * fine. Anything stricter here — trimming, a host-shape check — could call a value
 * unset that the SDK still routes on, and a guard that disagrees with the thing it
 * guards is worse than no guard.
 *
 * When Storage is switched on (storage.rules is deny-all until then, and says why),
 * FIREBASE_STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST has to join this pair in the same change. A third
 * product with its own variable is the same skew waiting to happen.
