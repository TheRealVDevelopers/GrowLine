/**
 * Browser-side Firebase: Auth, and — since v2.1b — a read-only Firestore.
 *
 * Every **write** still goes through API routes using the Admin SDK (D1, D38), and
 * `firestore.rules` denies client writes everywhere. The client Firestore exists
 * for one thing: listening. v2 §3 asks for QR submissions to appear without a
 * refresh, and a listener is the only way to do that without polling — which v1
 * §4.4 rules out, because background polling burns data on the cheap plans this
 * audience uses (D10).
 *
 * Phone auth MUST happen in the browser: Firebase issues the SMS and solves the
 * reCAPTCHA client-side, then hands back an ID token the server verifies.
