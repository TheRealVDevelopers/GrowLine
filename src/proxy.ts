/**
 * Is this a coach's public portfolio (F9)?
 *
 * Portfolios live at the ROOT — `growline.in/priyasharma` — because that URL gets
 * printed on posters and read down a phone. The cost lands here: this gate cannot tell
 * a coach's page from `/settings` by shape alone, and a rule as loose as "any single
 * segment is public" would unauthenticate every app route in one line.
 *
 * `RESERVED_SLUGS` is exactly the distinction, and it already exists for the other half
 * of the same problem — it is what stops a coach claiming a name a route would shadow.
 * Using it in both places means the two can never disagree, and the test that builds the
 * expected list by READING `src/app/` keeps it true as routes are added: a new
 * `src/app/pricing/` fails the suite until "pricing" is reserved, which is the same
 * moment it stops being publicly reachable here.
 *
 * Deliberately strict about shape. Only a lowercase single segment qualifies, so
 * `/Settings`, `/settings/x` and anything with a dot are never mistaken for a coach.
 *
 * Being "public" here only means the auth redirect is skipped. The page itself still
 * 404s unless the slug is claimed AND the coach published it.

  /**
   * `/login` is NOT redirected away when a cookie is present, deliberately.
   *
   * It used to be, and that turned a dead-but-present cookie into a redirect
   * loop. This gate can only see that a cookie EXISTS — verifying it needs the
   * Admin SDK, which cannot run here — so "has cookie" and "is signed in" are
   * different questions, and a revoked or expired session answers yes to the
   * first and no to the second. The cycle was:
   *
   *   /            -> layout cannot verify -> /api/auth/logout
   *   /api/auth/logout -> clears the cookie -> /login
   *   /login       -> cookie still on THIS request -> /
   *
   * and round again. Sending a signed-in coach from /login to home was a
   * convenience; bouncing a signed-out one between three routes is a lockout.
   * The authenticated layout is the only thing that can actually decide, so it
   * is the only thing that decides.
