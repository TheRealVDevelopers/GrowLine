# GROWLINE STATUS — last updated: 2026-08-14 · updated from: PC · branch: `feature/new-modules`

> Single source of truth between mobile and PC. Produced by a read-only audit that read
> code paths end to end — not commit messages, not filenames, not docs.

## Standing rules

1. **Every session — mobile or PC — reads this file first, and updates it before ending.**
   Mark items done, add new ones, refresh the date/device/branch line above.
2. **No session starts new work while ⚠️ CONFLICTS is non-empty**, unless the owner says so
   explicitly.
3. **New ideas that are discussed but not specced go under 🧊 PARKED** — listed, not built.
4. Anything that deviates from spec still goes in `DECISIONS.md` with its reasoning (RULES E6).

## How the audit classified things

Traced UI → API route → query function → Firestore collection → Security Rule. If any link
was missing, stubbed, unreachable, or behind a flag nobody sets, it is **not** DONE. Every
"DONE" claim was then handed to a separate pass whose only job was to refute it; three were
overturned and are recorded as PARTIAL below.

**Counts: 27 areas → 11 DONE · 15 PARTIAL · 1 NOT STARTED · 5 of the PARTIALs also CONFLICTING.**
(2026-08-14: Feature A, Portfolio Basic, the tier system and Feature B moved NOT STARTED →
DONE/PARTIAL. Bugs #2, #3, #6, #7 fixed; #16, #18, #19, #20 found and fixed; **#17 found
and NOT fixed — it is the launch blocker**; #21 found and fixed — the offline-capture
"flake" was a real product bug in the queue drain (D73).)

## 🧭 Branch situation

| Branch | State |
|---|---|
| `master` | **Fast-forwarded to `35fe28c` on 2026-08-14 — identical to `feature/new-modules`.** Everything below is on it. |
| `feature/new-modules` | Same commit as `master`. Still the working branch; new work continues here and merges forward. |
| `claude/mobile-pc-workflow-test-alhnwl` | Fully contained in both. Nothing lives only there. |

**No merge conflict has ever existed between these** — every merge so far has been a clean
fast-forward, this one included (27 commits ahead, 0 behind).

⚠️ A was already moot before this merge and stays that way: the Phase-2 modules (F13,
F14, F20, the quick-wins) reached `master` in the 2026-08-13 fast-forward, so this merge
added no contested work. What it added is workspaces, the Goal Sheet, Portfolio Basic,
the tier system, the Recognition Wall, the retention fix, the offline-queue fix and the
CI hardening. **The open question is unchanged and is still the owner's:** do the Phase-2
features stay, or come out before launch? Being on `master` is not the same as being
authorised.

## ✅ DONE (verified end-to-end, and survived a refutation pass)

- [x] **Phone-OTP auth + profiles + referral codes** — Firebase Phone auth; the old custom OTP
      is genuinely gone from `src/`, not dead code still shipping. Referral-code uniqueness is
      claimed inside `createUser`'s transaction via a reservation doc (`src/lib/users.ts:135-201`,
      D41). Logout revokes server-side; e2e replays a dead cookie to prove it.
- [x] **Team tree (3 levels, activity per node)** — real BFS over `users` capped at depth 3;
      per-node activity is genuine `dailyLogs`/`targets` data, not placeholders
      (`src/lib/team.ts:68-146`). Drill-down re-checks the requested root is inside the caller's
      own line (`src/app/api/team/route.ts:5-18`).
- [x] **Prospect capture — manual + public QR + offline queue** — consent enforced server-side
      with strict booleans; IndexedDB queue drains from the authenticated layout; idempotency is
      structural (composite doc id + `create()`), not lookup-then-insert. QR path is
      unauthenticated, rate-limited, `noindex`. Covered by real-emulator e2e.
- [x] **Wellness report engine + public report page + WhatsApp send**
- [x] **Daily log + streaks + upline roll-ups** — including the Streak Shield (one grace day
      per month), now wired through to the UI.
- [x] **Targets + proof validation**
- [x] **Privacy toggle UI in Settings** — and it is genuinely reachable: `PATCH /api/me` accepts
      `shareProspects` as a strict boolean.
- [x] **Phase 7 Threads** — compose, direct-vs-entire-line scope, acknowledge receipts with live
      counters, re-broadcast with attribution.
- [x] **Organisation workspaces (Feature C)** — the multi-tenant foundation.
      `users.workspaceId` is the single authority, written in the SAME transaction as the
      user so a coach cannot exist without one. Referral signup joins the sponsor's
      workspace; an unsponsored signup starts and owns its own — there is no shared default
      for strangers to land in together. Owner-only settings at `/workspace`: name, an
      accent restricted to the palette, and level names that start empty and are never
      suggested (RULES L1/L8). Verified: **16 isolation checks**
      (`npm run test:rules:workspaces`) which pair every denial with the permission it
      mirrors, so the suite cannot pass against a deny-all; and **12 placement checks**
      (`npm run verify:workspaces`). Server-side owner enforcement confirmed by hand — a
      member's PATCH gets 404, not just a hidden form.

- [x] **Feature B — Recognition Wall** — a feed of what coaches in the same workspace have
      DONE, where every card is minted by an event the app already records and none is ever
      typed. Six card types (first person, first member, streak, target reached, first
      downline, qualified), one 👏 whose one-per-person rule is the EXISTENCE of a document
      keyed by the clapper (not a counter somebody keeps honest), no comment box at all
      (RULES S3), 14-day expiry derived at read time with nothing deleted and no job, own
      workspace only re-checked when clapping, and a per-user opt-out enforced at BOTH
      write and read. Only {30, 100, 365} streaks reach the wall against the log's eight —
      a test pins the wall's set as a strict SUBSET, because a card for a day the log does
      not celebrate would show somebody's group a number they had never seen themselves.
      Reachable from More. Verified: **18 unit tests + 11 rules checks**
      (`npm run test:rules:wall`), the latter including a PERMITTED read as a control so
      the suite cannot pass against a deny-all.
- [x] **Portfolio Basic (F9)** — the last unbuilt piece of the v1 MVP. Root-level
      `growline.in/<slug>`: photo, name, city, headline, story, "Message me on WhatsApp"
      and "Join my club", with the free-tier watermark. The slug is claimed
      transactionally through a reservation document whose id IS the slug (D41's shape),
      and releasing the old name happens in the same transaction as claiming the new one.
      Publishing is its own switch, driven by the server response rather than
      optimistically. The WhatsApp button is a redirect route rather than a `wa.me` href,
      because this is the one page in the app that asks to be indexed and a personal
      mobile number does not belong in crawlable HTML. Reachable from More. Verified:
      **24 unit tests + 2 e2e** in which a real signed-out browser reads a published page
      and gets a 404 on an unpublished one — the test that caught the auth gate eating
      the entire feature (🐛 #19).
- [x] **Feature A — Goal Sheet ("My Why") + the target conversation** — the whole feature,
      not the foundation. The three-step sheet with a skip on every step and a completion
      meter counting STEPS not fields (`GoalSheetForm.tsx`); the personal-reason panel in
      the calm register with sharing OFF by default; the upline gate that puts the sheet in
      front of the number rather than beside it, with the old inline input removed from
      `LineTargets.tsx` so there is no way around it (`TargetGate.tsx`); the reverse-math
      running volume-in/activity-out with every assumption editable and a warning when the
      arithmetic asks for more hours than the coach said they have; blockers-become-actions,
      one line per ticked blocker and the free-text note as context rather than a seventh
      input row; "I accept this target" and "Ask to talk" on the home screen, disappearing
      the moment there is nothing to do (`TargetToAccept.tsx`); the month-end review; and the
      nudge that fires after the first prospect and **never at signup** — asked before a
      coach has used the app once, the sheet fills with a throwaway answer nobody revises,
      which is worse than empty. Verified: **19 privacy checks**
      (`npm run test:rules:goals`, up from 13 — the six new ones prove the grandparent
      cannot read a renegotiation and that nobody can accept from a browser) and **47 unit
      tests**. **Only the dream photo is outstanding**, blocked on Storage being deny-all
      (D49).

**Not messy, worth stating:** three independent audit passes read `firestore.rules` for
different reasons and described it identically — `users` deny-all, the `prospects`
`shareProspects` gate, `dailyLogs`/`targets` deny-all. The privacy core is consistent.

---

## 🟡 IN PROGRESS / PARTIAL

- [ ] **Firebase migration** — done: Auth, Firestore, Security Rules, Cloud Functions.
      **missing:** Storage is deny-all and unused (photos and proof media are still base64 data
      URLs, D49); **FCM was never built — push still runs Web Push/VAPID.** · branch: both
- [ ] **Design System 2.0** — done: dark-default token layer, gold/jewel palette, serif+sans,
      screens reskinned. **missing:** the 8-item Jewel Asset Pack (`assets/jewels/`) does not
      exist; tier plaques/medals have nowhere to render until Tiers ships. · branch: both
- [ ] **Mode A consent** — done: the tick, strict server enforcement, survives the offline
      queue. **missing:** the itemized privacy-notice link the same spec item requires (D61).
- [ ] **Bundled fonts (Kannada/Devanagari + bold)** — done: real TTFs committed, no Google fetch
      at render time, prospect names no longer leak to Google. **missing:** satori does no
      complex-script shaping, so Indic names still render *incorrectly* (D66). The tests check
      glyph coverage, not shaping, so they cannot catch this.
- [ ] **Retention purge (180 days)** — done: the Cloud Function exists, is scheduled, and
      as of 2026-08-14 measures true inactivity (🐛 #3, D69). **missing:** it has never run
      against real Firebase, and `npm run backfill:prospect-activity` MUST run once on the
      production database before the first purge — until it does, pre-existing prospects
      have no `lastActivityAt` and are skipped, so their health data is retained past the
      window the privacy notice promises.
- [ ] **Automated tests + CI** — done: CI runs unit (497), **all seven rules suites (178
      assertions, every one now blocking)**, `functions/` typecheck, re-parent verification,
      and e2e (43). **missing:** no tests inside `functions/` itself — typechecking is not
      the same as knowing the retention purge selects the right rows (🐛 #3, #6). And the
      whole suite runs against emulators only, which is 🐛 #17: the emulator invents missing
      composite indexes, so no test here can fail the way production will.
- [ ] **F13 Leaderboards · F14 Qualifications · F20 Duplication · the quick wins**
      (voice-note log, who-to-call, silence alerts) — **AUTHORISED to ship 2026-08-14
      (D74)**, and no longer disputed or unreachable. Built with rules and tests; all four
      reachable from `/more`; all nine Cloud Functions export and compile, verified against
      `functions/lib/index.js`. **The only thing missing is `CRON_SECRET`** — without it the
      six scheduled jobs fail closed, so the boards stay empty, the duplication page reads
      "nothing counted yet" forever, and qualifications never evaluate or remind. That is
      now a launch blocker rather than a background nag, because these screens are
      user-facing: a coach who opens one and finds it permanently blank concludes the app
      is broken. · branch: both (on `master` since the 2026-08-14 fast-forward)
- [ ] **Branch/repo hygiene** — a stray git worktree, an uncommitted lint fix, two parallel
      decision logs. See ⚠️ C and 🐛 #10.

---

## ⚠️ CONFLICTS / DUPLICATES — resolve before building anything new

**~~A. Phase-2 work shipped early, against RULES S7.~~ RESOLVED 2026-08-14 — the owner
authorised it: "keep the phase 2 features, don't remove anything." Recorded as D74.**

F13 Leaderboards, F14 Qualifications, F20 Duplication and the quick wins (voice-note log,
who-to-call, silence alerts) ship. **RULES S7 is not repealed** — §8's remaining items
(social feed, event manager, poster library, club-owner module, advanced analytics + PDF)
stay parked until the 200-paying-user bar. One authorised exception is not the rule's
repeal, and a future session wanting the event manager needs its own owner decision.

→ **What the decision obliges, and it is not nothing:** these features are now user-facing,
so they have to work. Verified today — all nine Cloud Functions export and compile
(`functions/lib/index.js`), and all four screens are reachable from `/more`. **The one
thing left is `CRON_SECRET`**, and keeping the features promotes it from a background nag
to a launch blocker: without it the six jobs fail closed, so the boards stay empty, the
duplication page reads "nothing counted yet" forever and qualifications never evaluate.
A coach opening a feature that never fills in concludes the app is broken — worse than the
feature not existing.

**B. FCM vs Web Push — the spec override was never reconciled.**
`BUILD_PROMPT_V2` §3 says *"FCM replaces Web Push/VAPID entirely"*, and v2 wins on conflict.
`DECISIONS.md` D22 still records VAPID as the decision, and the code still runs it.
→ **Recommendation:** keep VAPID for now (it works for web), but record the deferral in
`DECISIONS.md` explicitly. It becomes blocking at Phase 10 — Capacitor Android has no other
delivery path.

**~~C. Two parallel decision logs, both claiming to be canonical.~~ RESOLVED 2026-08-19.**
The N-series is folded into `DECISIONS.md` as its own section and
`src/modules/DECISIONS-new-modules.md` is deleted. Nothing was renumbered — the N-series
never collided with the D-series, so every N-number cited in a code comment still
resolves, which is what made the fold mechanical rather than risky. The one code
reference (`src/modules/qualifications/evaluate.ts`) now names the section.

**~~D. `CRON_SECRET` / `timingSafeEqual` implemented three times.~~ RESOLVED 2026-08-19.**
All six cron routes go through `checkCronSecret` in `src/modules/shared-new/cron.ts`; the
two inline copies are gone and the helper no longer describes itself as covering only
"the new" routes. The e2e that refuses strangers at these endpoints covered two of the
six and now covers all six. Verified against a running server in both directions — a
wrong bearer token gets 401 and the right one 200 — which the e2e's `[401, 503]` cannot
distinguish.

**E. E7 ("push after every change") is being violated right now.**
`eslint.config.mjs` sits uncommitted with a complete, reasoned fix.
→ **Recommendation:** commit it or reject it. See 🐛 #10.

---

## ❌ NOT STARTED (dependency-ordered)

1. [ ] **Translated privacy notice** — depends on: the owner supplying legal entity name,
       grievance-officer contact and postal address, then native-speaker review (D61, D59).
       Independent of the chain below.
2. [ ] **Phase 8 Portfolio — BASIC IS DONE 2026-08-14, PRO is not.** Basic (F9) needed no
       Storage and is built: root-level `growline.in/<slug>`, transactional slug claim,
       headline/story, publish switch, WhatsApp + join buttons, free-tier watermark, and
       it is reachable from More. 24 unit tests + 2 e2e (a real signed-out stranger reads
       a published page and gets a 404 on an unpublished one). **Pro still depends on
       Firebase Storage** + a thumbnail function — the transformation gallery is the part
       that needs it, and building it on data-URLs would repeat the D3/D49 pattern v2 was
       meant to close.
3. [ ] **Phase 9 Tiers — TIER SYSTEM DONE 2026-08-14 (D70), RAZORPAY NOT.** Built with
       every gate standing OPEN by owner instruction ("start tiers now, don't gate anything
       yet"): the Starter/Leader/Elite model, 2nd-downline qualification, 30-day trial
       clock, `/plans` (Trust Zone, honest that nothing is locked), the recognition card,
       the admin funnel, and `gateLeaderTool` wired into targets / threads / proof-review.
       `TIERS_ENFORCED = false` in `src/modules/tiers/model.ts` is the one flip; the unit
       suite pins both positions and the e2e has a real Starter set a target and send a
       thread through the real routes. The v1 60-day countdown is deleted from Home and
       Settings.

       **Razorpay: DONE pending keys, 2026-08-19 (D75).** Model, client, store, four
       routes, the checkout/cancel controls, and the wiring: `PaymentControls` is mounted
       on `/plans` behind `hasSubscription || (isConfigured() && TIERS_ENFORCED)` so it
       cannot sell a tier whose tools are already free, Settings' "My plan" card reads the
       real money state, and the admin funnel counts `paid` apart from `granted`.
       `e2e/payments.spec.ts` visits every payments route in a signed-out browser (D68's
       lesson — Razorpay has no session). 617 unit tests, 8 e2e.

       **Promo codes: DONE 2026-08-19 (D76).** Admin mints at `/admin/promo-codes`
       (bounded, audited); a coach redeems on `/plans` behind "Have a code?". A code is
       free Leader DAYS and never touches Razorpay. Days are added to a live run rather
       than replacing it; one redemption per coach per code, structurally. 639 unit
       tests, 6 e2e.

       D76 also records the trap it found: `effectiveTier` expired only
       `source === "trial"`, so a promo grant carrying an end date would never have
       expired — one launch code would have been permanent free Leader for everyone who
       typed it. Expiry now keys on the date.

       The flip is a set of three (constant, /plans banner, start-trial refusal), is an
       OWNER decision, and needs the five `RAZORPAY_*` vars in the environment first.
4. [ ] **Phase 10 — onboarding tour, Capacitor Android, Play Store prep** — depends on: Tiers,
       and on **FCM** (Web Push cannot reach a native app).
5. ~~[ ] **Feature A — Goal Sheet ("My Why")**~~ → **COMPLETE 2026-08-14**, moved to ✅ DONE.
6. ~~[ ] **Feature B — Recognition Wall**~~ → **BUILT 2026-08-14 (D71)**, moved to ✅ DONE.

## 🐛 BUGS FOUND (recorded, not fixed)

1. ~~**CRITICAL — six Cloud Functions are written but never exported from
   `functions/src/index.ts`, so none of them deploy.**~~ **FIXED 2026-08-12 on
   `feature/new-modules`.** All six now exported: `rebuildLeaderboards`,
   `evaluateQualifications`, `qualificationReminders`, `rebuildDuplicationScores`,
   `silenceCheck`, `purgeVoiceNotes`. Verified by compiling — `functions/lib/index.js` exposes
   all nine functions (the three originals plus these six). `functions/` typechecks clean.
   **Still blocked on one thing:** `CRON_SECRET` is blank in `.env.example`, so every one of
   them fails closed until it is provisioned in the real deployment. Exporting was necessary,
   not sufficient. See also ⚠️ A — four of the six belong to features whose authorisation is
   still an open question; exporting fixed the code, it did not settle whether it should ship.
16. **HIGH — `npm run e2e` failed all 43 tests on a machine with no web server, and it
    looked like the app was broken.** Happened twice in one session on 2026-08-14; the
    second time it was briefly read as a real regression before the log showed 43×
    `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3000`. `playwright.config.ts` had no `webServer` block, so the
    suite assumed somebody had run `next start` in another terminal — true in CI, where
    `ci-integration.sh` starts one, and false on every developer machine.
    → **FIXED 2026-08-14**: `webServer` with `command: "npx next start"` and
    `reuseExistingServer: true`. Reuse is unconditional rather than the usual
    `!process.env.CI`, because CI starts its own server inside the emulator lifetime and
    Playwright must attach to it rather than race a second process for port 3000.

19. ~~**BLOCKER — the public portfolio was not public.**~~ **FIXED 2026-08-14, same day
    it was written.** `proxy.ts` redirects anything without a session to `/login`, and a
    coach's page lives at the ROOT — so every prospect following a printed link would
    have landed on a login screen for an app they will never install. The feature was
    entirely decorative and `next build`, `tsc` and 528 unit tests all passed anyway.
    Found only by writing the e2e test that opens the page as a real signed-out stranger.
    → The gate now treats a lowercase single segment as a portfolio **unless it is in
    `RESERVED_SLUGS`** — the same list that stops a coach claiming a name a route would
    shadow, so the two can never disagree, and the filesystem-driven test keeps it true
    as routes are added.
    **The lesson worth keeping: a public page needs a test that visits it with no
    session.** Nothing else in the stack can tell you the auth gate is eating it.

20. ~~**MEDIUM — the publish switch reported success before the server agreed.**~~
    **FIXED 2026-08-14.** It flipped local state and saved afterwards, so "Your page is
    live" rendered while the request was still in flight — and a failed save left the
    switch flipped over a page nobody could see. State now comes from the response.

18. **MEDIUM — `npm run e2e:reset` did not re-seed, so fixture dates aged into failures
    that read as app bugs.** The name and the docs both present it as the thing you run
    before e2e, but it only reset the emulator and re-migrated — from a `dev.db` that might
    have been seeded days ago. On 2026-08-14 that produced `e2e/session4.spec.ts:105`
    expecting "1 day late" and getting "2 days late", which is bug #12 returning by a
    different route: #12 fixed the fixture to be relative to when it is WRITTEN, and this is
    the case where it is never rewritten. Both failures in that run
    (`session4` and the `realtime` flake) passed immediately after a manual `db:seed`.
    → **FIXED 2026-08-14**: `e2e:reset` now runs `db:seed` first, and CI's separate
    `db:seed` line is removed rather than duplicated.

17. **BLOCKER (still open, now actionable) — nothing has ever run against real Firebase,
    and the emulator is more permissive than production in a way no test can see.**
    *2026-08-20: the project exists — `grow--line` (double hyphen), carried as the `prod`
    alias in `.firebaserc`, with an ordered cutover runbook in `HANDOFF.md` § Blocking
    cutover. What still blocks the run is `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.* A query needing a
    composite index that does not exist throws `FAILED_PRECONDITION` the first time a real
    coach opens the screen; the emulator creates missing indexes silently on demand, so
    every suite here passes against an instance that cannot reproduce the failure. CI is
    structurally incapable of catching this and it is the most likely launch-day outage.
    → **Partly addressed 2026-08-14**: `npm run verify:indexes` runs all twenty compound
    query shapes and reports the ones Firestore refuses, surfacing the console URL that
    creates each missing index. It uses ids that cannot exist, so it is safe against
    production data. **This is not closed until somebody runs it against the real project
    with the emulator host variables unset.** Against the emulator it passes trivially, and
    the script says so rather than reporting a pass.

2. ~~**HIGH — four of five Security Rules suites (88 assertions) never run in CI.**~~
   **FIXED 2026-08-14.** All six previously-unwired suites — boards, quals, duplication,
   session4, workspaces, goals — now run inside the same emulator lifetime as the mandatory
   prospects suite in `.github/scripts/ci-integration.sh`, and every one blocks the merge.
   **178 rules assertions across 7 suites** are enforced now rather than optional.
3. ~~**HIGH — `purgeStaleHealthData` purges by record age, not inactivity**~~ **FIXED
   2026-08-14, D69.** Now keys off `lastActivityAt`, seeded at capture and pushed forward
   by exactly the two events RULES P5 names — a stage move and the prospect opening their
   own report. Not by a coach editing notes (that is not contact with the person) and not
   by the coach previewing their own send. The report-view touch throttles to one write a
   day, because writing on every view puts an unbounded write on an unauthenticated route.
   **A missing value is never purged** — failing toward keeping data is the only safe
   direction for an irreversible delete — and
   `npm run backfill:prospect-activity -- --check` exits non-zero while any row still
   lacks the field. The composite index moved with the query, with a test asserting they
   match; the emulator invents missing indexes, so nothing else here would have noticed.
   *As originally recorded:* it contradicted RULES P5's literal *"180 days of prospect
   inactivity — no stage change, no report view"*; no `lastActivityAt` field existed to
   measure it; and unlike every other deliberate simplification here it had no
   `DECISIONS.md` entry — which is roughly how it survived.
4. **MEDIUM — push still on Web Push/VAPID, not FCM.** Works for web; means Phase 10's Android
   delivery starts from scratch. See ⚠️ B.
5. **MEDIUM — `/voice-log` and `/who-to-call` are unreachable from any navigation.** Only via
   `/more` or a typed URL (`AppNav.tsx:29-33`). Documented as deliberate, but as shipped a coach
   following the UI never finds them.
6. ~~**MEDIUM — the `functions/` package is not built, typechecked or tested in CI**~~
   **PARTLY FIXED 2026-08-14.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs `npm ci` and
   `npm run typecheck` in `functions/`, so a compile error in the retention purge — the one
   job that irreversibly deletes user data — can no longer reach deploy. Still no TESTS in
   that package: typechecking is not the same as knowing the purge selects the right rows,
   and bug #3 is exactly the kind of thing a typecheck cannot see.
7. ~~**LOW — stale home-screen copy.**~~ **FIXED 2026-08-14.** The "Coming next on Growline"
   card is removed rather than trimmed: both features it promised — targets with your
   upline, messages from your line — now exist, and a card promising what the user already
   has reads as a dead app. It returns when there is a real next thing to promise.
8. **LOW — proof photos are still base64 in Firestore; video proofs unsupported** despite the
   spec saying Firebase unblocks them. Documented (D49).
9. **LOW — one `todo` test in `tests/wellness.test.ts`** records that the healthy-weight upper
   bound doesn't round-trip to the "In the general range" label at every height.
10. ~~**LOW — `eslint.config.mjs` uncommitted.**~~ **FIXED 2026-08-12.** Now ignores `.claude/**`
    (a stray agent worktree otherwise makes lint report 687 errors / 13,525 warnings from a
    clean tree) and `functions/lib/**` (the Cloud Functions build output is CommonJS, so it
    trips `no-require-imports` 15 times the moment anybody builds before deploying). Git
    already ignored both; these are the lint half of the same fact. The stray worktree at
    `.claude/worktrees/continue-previous-3413cb` still exists and is still nobody's.
11. ~~**HIGH — `feature/new-modules` does not pass lint, so CI fails on it.**~~ **FIXED
    2026-08-12.** `src/modules/voice-log/Recorder.tsx` mirrored a browser capability into
    state with `useEffect(() => setPhase(canRecord() ? … ), [])` — a synchronous setState on
    every mount, so the component rendered "checking", threw it away and rendered again. Now
    read through `useSyncExternalStore`, the same fix `ThemeToggle` needed for the same
    reason. A lazy `useState` initialiser would NOT have worked: `canRecord()` touches
    `MediaRecorder` and `navigator.mediaDevices`, neither of which exists during the server
    render, so it would have traded a lint error for a hydration mismatch. All five real
    phase transitions are untouched. Verified in a browser: the server ships the skeleton,
    the client hydrates to "Hold to record", and the console shows no hydration mismatch.
    Lint is now **0 errors** on this branch; 4 unused-variable warnings remain in
    `e2e/session4.spec.ts` and `src/modules/voice-log/queries.ts` (warnings do not block).

12. ~~**MEDIUM — `e2e/session4.spec.ts:71` fails, and gets worse every day.**~~ **FIXED
    2026-08-13.** The app was right ("2 days late"); the fixture was stale. Both
    `scripts/seed-sqlite.ts` and `scripts/verify-migration.ts` had hardcoded absolute dates,
    so a fixture meaning "yesterday" was only true for 24 hours. Everything is now derived
    from the real clock through `day.ts` (RULES E1 — "yesterday" between midnight and 05:30
    IST is a different day in UTC).

    Three things this surfaced that were not obvious, all now written into the code:
    - `memberships: key === "2026-08-09"` compared against the *old* fixed date, so going
      relative would have silently seeded **zero** memberships everywhere.
    - `verify-migration.ts` asserts Meera's follow-up is in the **future**, while
      `session4.spec.ts` needs her **late**. Both are right: the verifier now passes an
      explicit `as of three days ago` to `followupCounts`, which is exactly what that
      parameter exists for.
    - Logs must **not** be dated today. A qualification counts `daysActive` and
      `newMembers` inside a window that opens when it is created, so a log dated today
      lands inside every fresh qualification and `qualifications.spec.ts` — which asserts a
      coach starting from zero — breaks. The old seed got this right *by accident*, because
      it had gone stale. It is now deliberate, with the trade recorded: seeded coaches have
      no live streak, which is the lesser problem.

13. **HIGH — Playwright loads every `e2e/*.test.ts` and one of them can end the run early
    while still exiting 0.** `playwright.config.ts` sets `testDir: "./e2e"` and **no
    `testMatch`**, so the default pattern matches `*.test.ts` as well as `*.spec.ts`. The
    six Security-Rules suites live there as plain `tsx` scripts that run `main()` at module
    scope and finish with `process.exit()`. Playwright executes them while discovering
    tests, and whichever `process.exit(0)` lands first truncates the run — **no summary, a
    fraction of the tests executed, exit code 0.** Caught because adding a sixth suite
    shifted the timing enough to make it happen every time; it has been latent, and a green
    e2e on this branch has been partly luck. It was also masking a real failure: with the
    truncation gone the suite immediately reported one.
    → ~~Fix is one line~~ **FIXED 2026-08-13**: `testMatch: "**/*.spec.ts"` in `playwright.config.ts`. Was NOT
    applied — that file is outside the five approved for this session. Worked around for
    now by keeping the new suite at `scripts/verify-workspace-rules.ts` instead, which is
    structurally immune; the five older suites are still in `e2e/` and still hazardous.
14. **MEDIUM — `/workspace` is not reachable from any navigation.** URL-only, same position
    as `/voice-log` and `/who-to-call` (🐛 #5). The bottom bar is full at five tabs and a
    sixth is the owner's call.
15. **MEDIUM — the backfill must run after any migration or reset, before signups.**
    `seed-sqlite.ts` and `migrate-to-firestore.ts` write no `workspaceId` (both are outside
    the approved file set), so a fresh database has every coach unassigned until
    `npm run backfill:workspaces` runs. `createUser` fails visibly rather than silently in
    that window — an upline with no workspace does not hand down an empty one, the new coach
    starts their own — but that leaves a tree straddling two workspaces, which is the one
    thing the referral rule exists to prevent. `npm run backfill:workspaces -- --check`
    exits non-zero while anyone is unassigned, which is what makes this enforceable.

16. ~~**HIGH — the app is not installable: there is no web app manifest.**~~ **FIXED
    2026-08-20.** `src/app/manifest.ts` (Next metadata route, so the `<link rel="manifest">`
    cannot drift from the file), five icons generated from one SVG source by
    `scripts/make-icons.ts`, Apple metadata in the layout because iOS ignores the manifest,
    and `icons` added to `RESERVED_SLUGS`. Verified by Chromium's own parser over CDP —
    0 errors, 4 icons with correct purposes, 3 shortcuts — plus 8 unit tests pinning the
    fields Chrome requires and 2 signed-out e2e tests (D68: a manifest redirected to
    /login returns HTML with a 200 and silently kills installation). Original finding
    below, kept because it is why the tests exist.

    Found by the 2026-08-19 feature audit; recorded nowhere before it. `public/sw.js` exists and caches
    routes for the weak-signal case, so the offline half of the PWA works — but there is no
    `manifest.json`, no `src/app/manifest.ts`, and no `manifest` link in the root layout.
    Without one Android offers no "Add to home screen", there is no standalone display mode,
    and there is no app icon. v1 §10 asks for "an installable PWA … AND the same experience
    in a desktop browser"; only the second half is true today. Cheap to fix (a manifest, a
    set of icons, one `<link>`), and worth fixing before a pilot club is asked to install
    anything. Note that `RESERVED_SLUGS` in `src/modules/portfolio/model.ts` already reserves
    the route name `manifest`, so nothing has to move to make room for it.

17. **MEDIUM — "five languages" is 28 strings.** `src/lib/dictionaries/` holds `en`, `hi`,
    `kn`, `ta`, `te`, and each dictionary has **28 keys**. The switcher works and the report
    fonts render every script correctly, so the plumbing is real — but the overwhelming
    majority of the interface is English-only, and a coach who picks Kannada sees a handful
    of translated labels on otherwise English screens. This is not a defect in what was
    built; it is a gap between what the code does and what "Kannada / Hindi / Marathi UI
    localisation" (v1 §8) will be read to mean. Decide before a pilot whether to finish the
    dictionaries or describe the feature honestly as partial.

**Flaky, not broken:** `e2e/realtime.spec.ts` failed once in a full run and passed alone
and on the very next full run (43/43). Shared emulator state and ordering, same family as
D44. Watch it; do not "fix" it by weakening the assertion.

**✅ RESOLVED 2026-08-14 — `e2e/offline-capture.spec.ts` was never a flaky test. It was a
real product bug, and it is fixed (D73).**

It failed in three consecutive full runs and passed alone every time, which is what got
it filed as flaky twice. The trace settled it: exactly ONE `POST /api/prospects`, aborted
while offline, and no second attempt ever. `OfflineSync` drained on four EDGES — mount,
`online`, a queue write, a tab becoming visible — and `if (!navigator.onLine) return`
treated being offline as terminal. When the signal returned a few milliseconds before the
next page loaded, the `online` event fired on the page being torn down and the fresh
mount read `navigator.onLine` before the renderer caught up. Both edges missed and the
captured person stayed in IndexedDB.

**This needed no test to happen.** One flaky drain on a weak signal stranded a real
capture, after the coach was told "saved on this phone" — the exact silent failure the
spec's own header warns about. The queue is now a LEVEL, not an edge: while anything is
queued it retries with backoff (2s→30s, one timer, cleared on unmount), and a returning
signal resets the backoff.

Verified: three consecutive full suites at **49/49**, against three consecutive failures
before. Pinned by `tests/offline-sync.test.ts`, whose MANDATORY check was confirmed to
FAIL against the original one-line defect — a source test that passes against the bug it
describes is decorative, so it was checked both ways.

**STILL OPEN, third sighting — 2026-08-19, on CI, and now shown to be INTERMITTENT.**
`e2e/offline-capture.spec.ts` ("a capture made offline survives and syncs when the signal
returns") failed on the first CI run that ever reached the e2e suite: 61 passed, 1
skipped, this one failed. The queued capture never appeared within the 20s window.

The next run passed — 63/63, CI fully green — and the two runs differ by **one
documentation file** (`5e2db0f` → `610a6bd`, STATUS.md only). Identical application code,
one fail then one pass: intermittent on CI, roughly 1-in-2 so far.

**Intermittent is not the same as harmless, and D73 is why.** That entry describes the
identical symptom being filed as flaky twice before the trace showed a real
capture-losing bug. A green re-run is evidence about frequency, not about cause. Note
also that the workflow uploads Playwright artefacts `if: failure()` only, so a passing
run leaves no trace behind — the failing run's artefact is the only diagnostic that
exists.

What is known:

- **Not caused by the payments/promo work.** It runs before every spec added that day
  (alphabetical order puts it ahead of `payments`, `promo`) and touches none of the
  changed code.
- **Not reproducible in the cloud container.** Three full suites from a fresh
  `e2e:reset`, plus five isolated runs, plus two runs with all four cores saturated —
  green every time, 3.2s to 4.7s.
- **The container and CI have never run the same browser.** `playwright.config.ts`
  resolves `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`, which in this image is a symlink to
  **chromium-1194**; CI runs `npx playwright install chromium` and gets
  **chromium-1234**. Every "e2e green" ever recorded from a cloud session was measured
  on 1194. This spec is the only one in the suite that depends on browser-level network
  emulation (`context.setOffline`), so it is exactly the test where a build difference
  would show up first. **Hypothesis, not a finding** — it has not been tested, because
  the container is configured not to download a browser.
- **D73 is the reason this must not be filed as flaky again.** The same symptom was
  recorded as flaky twice and turned out to be a real capture-losing bug: one aborted
  POST and no retry, stranding a capture after the coach was told "saved on this phone".
  The fix (drain on a level, backoff 2/4/8/15/30s) is still in
  `src/components/OfflineSync.tsx` and its unit test still passes.

**Next step, and it needs somebody who can reach the artifact:** the run uploaded a
Playwright trace (run 32244918774, artifact `playwright-results`, 941KB). D73 was solved
by reading exactly this — the question is whether a second `POST /api/prospects` ever
happened after the signal returned. If it did and was rejected, the bug is on the replay
path; if it never fired, the drain missed again on a browser this repo has not been
testing against. Re-running the job from this session was refused (403), and the
artifact needs a token to download.

**Not quarantined, not skipped, not weakened.** CI is green on
`claude/pull-everything-2hzx4h` as of `610a6bd` — the first fully green run this
repository has ever had — but this test is expected to fail again, and it should be
investigated from the trace rather than watched until somebody stops noticing.

## 🚫 BLOCKED / NEEDS A HUMAN DECISION

**Authorisation**
- ~~F13 / F14 / F20 / quick-wins: authorise and fold in, or hold unmerged?~~ **DECIDED
  2026-08-14 — they ship (D74).** RULES S7 still parks the rest of §8; one exception is
  not the rule.
- ~~Who may add the six missing exports to `functions/src/index.ts`?~~ **Moot — they were
  added on 2026-08-12 and all nine functions compile (verified in `functions/lib/`).**
- Is `CRON_SECRET` provisioned in the real deployment, for the six new jobs *and* the two
  existing ones (`morningReminder`, `purgeStaleHealthData`)?
- **The five `RAZORPAY_*` vars** — `KEY_ID`, `KEY_SECRET`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
  `PLAN_MONTHLY`, `PLAN_ANNUAL` (`.env.example` documents all five; two are secrets).
  Payments are code-complete and fail closed without them: `isConfigured()` is false, so
  `/plans` shows no purchase controls, `/api/payments/subscribe` answers 503 with a
  sentence, and the admin funnel still says "Razorpay is not connected". Nothing breaks
  and nothing is charged — but nobody can pay, which is the business model. The two plan
  ids are created ONCE in the Razorpay dashboard; the webhook URL is
  `/api/payments/webhook` on `subscription.*` events. Same standing as `CRON_SECRET`:
  config, not code, and only the owner can supply it.

**Architecture**
- Storage: deferred until something forces it, or does v2.1b stay incomplete until Storage +
  the resize function land — and does Portfolio block on it?
- FCM: required now per §3's literal language, or acceptable to defer to the Capacitor build?
- Who produces the 8-item Jewel Asset Pack? Not derivable from code.

**Compliance**
- Owner must supply: **legal entity name, grievance-officer contact, postal address** — the
  privacy notice cannot be written without them.
- ~~**Native-speaker review** of the four UI translations~~ — **DONE 2026-08-14 (D72).**
  No rule violations; all four rated genuinely spoken register. Three changes applied
  (Hindi क्यूआर→QR, Telugu ముందుకు పంపండి→ఫార్వర్డ్ చేయండి, Kannada ಸ್ವಾಸ್ಥ್ಯ→ಆರೋಗ್ಯ); three
  rejected by a second reader. **Ten proposals remain UNVERIFIED and unapplied** — the
  review ran out of budget mid-pass. All are register polish, none is a defect, and a
  human native speaker should settle them:
  - Kannada: `common.cancel` ರದ್ದು → ರದ್ದುಮಾಡಿ · `log.title` ಇಂದಿನ → ಇವತ್ತಿನ ·
    `common.offline` ಸಂಪರ್ಕ ಇಲ್ಲ → ಇಂಟರ್ನೆಟ್ ಇಲ್ಲ · `prospects.myQr` ಕ್ಯೂಆರ್ → QR
  - Tamil: `prospects.myQr` குறியீடு → கோட் · `threads.acknowledged` பார்த்தாயிற்று →
    பார்த்துவிட்டேன் · `log.streakDays` {days} நாள் தொடர்ச்சி → தொடர்ந்து {days} நாள் ·
    `settings.language.reportNote` clause reorder · `prospects.search` எண் → நம்பர்
  - Hindi: the `settings.language.reportNote` tail, if the more spoken tone is wanted
    (the second reader offered a counter-proposal — see D72).
- ~~`purgeStaleHealthData`: fix to key off true last activity, or accept age-based purge?~~
  **DECIDED 2026-08-14 (D69):** fixed to measure real inactivity. No longer open.

**Process**
- ~~Wire the four unwired rules suites into CI?~~ **DONE 2026-08-14** — all eight run and block.
- A 6th nav tab for voice-log / who-to-call, or a link from Home?
- Commit or reject the pending `eslint.config.mjs` fix; remove the stray worktree?
