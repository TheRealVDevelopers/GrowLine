/**
 * Workspace isolation — the property the whole multi-tenant design rests on.
 *
 * The requirement is "a user in workspace A cannot read anything in workspace B", and the
 * only way that test is worth anything is if the SAME reads succeed inside A. A suite that
 * only ever asserts failure would pass just as happily against a deny-all ruleset, and
 * would keep passing after somebody accidentally denied the app its own data — so every
 * denial here is paired with the permission it is the mirror of.
