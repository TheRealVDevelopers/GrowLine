/**
 * Runs every compound query the app makes, and reports the ones Firestore refuses.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A Firestore query needing a composite index that does not exist throws
 * FAILED_PRECONDITION at runtime. Not at deploy, not at build — the first time a real
 * user opens the screen. And the emulator CREATES missing indexes silently on demand, so
 * every test we have passes against an instance that is more permissive than production.
 * CI is structurally incapable of catching this class, which makes it the single most
 * likely thing to break on launch day.
 *
 * The only honest check is to execute the real query shapes against the real thing. That
 * is what this does.
 *
 *     npm run verify:indexes          # against whatever .env points at
 *
 * Against the emulator it will pass trivially — that is expected and is not a result.
 * **Point it at the production project before launch**, with the emulator host variables
 * UNSET and a service account that can read. It reads at most a handful of documents per
 * query and writes nothing.
 *
 * ## What a failure gives you
 *
 * Firestore's error carries a console URL that creates the exact missing index. Add the
 * index to `firestore.indexes.json` as well — the URL fixes production, the file is what
 * stops the next environment starting broken.
 *
 * ## What this cannot tell you
 *
 * Only that the index EXISTS. Not that it is fast, and not that it is cheap. A query that
 * returns in 40ms against 30 seeded documents can still be the wrong shape at 30,000.

/**
 * Every compound query in `src/` and `functions/`, named by where it runs.
 *
 * A query is listed when Firestore may need a composite index for it: an equality plus a
 * range or orderBy on a DIFFERENT field, an array-contains plus anything, or an `in` plus
 * an orderBy. Equality-only queries and single-field ranges are served by the automatic
 * single-field indexes and are deliberately absent — listing them would pad the count
 * without checking anything.
 *
 * The filter VALUES are deliberate nonsense. Firestore validates the index before it
 * looks for data, so a query matching nothing still proves the index exists — and probing
 * with ids that cannot exist means this is safe to run against production data.
