/**
 * Resets the Firestore and Auth emulators to empty.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The e2e suite is not idempotent, and it cannot be: `signup.spec` creates a coach,
 * `offline-capture.spec` and the QR spec each create a prospect. Run it twice against
 * the same emulator and the second run sees a database that no longer matches the
 * seed — team counts drift, `migrate:verify` reports MISMATCH, and assertions on
 * "how many people are in my line" fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the
 * code under test.
 *
 * That cost a full debugging cycle once already: a green 18/18 suite went to 6 failed
 * with no code change, purely because the emulator had accumulated two signup users
 * and four extra prospects. The failure looked exactly like a regression.
 *
 * So: reset, then re-migrate, before every e2e run. `npm run e2e:reset` does both.
 *
 * Auth matters as much as Firestore. Signup creates a Firebase Auth account, and
 * Auth's Phone provider allows one account per number — the invariant that lets the
 * user document be keyed by uid (D34). Leaving accounts behind means the next run's
 * signup either collides or silently signs in as the previous run's user.
