/**
 * Security Rules tests for `leaderboardSnapshots` (F13).
 *
 *   npm run test:rules:boards
 *
 * House style (e2e/rules.test.ts): real authenticated clients against the emulator
 * with the real rules file, and every check states the rule it defends and why.
 *
 * ## The two that matter most
 *
 * MANDATORY — the roster document is unreadable by everybody. It holds the full
 * ordering, bottom included, and the participant count. The brief's hardest
 * requirement is that a coach in last place can never learn it, and the only way to
 * make that true rather than merely rendered is for the ordering not to be
 * obtainable from a browser at all. The screen slices each coach's upward-only
 * window out of this document on the server.
 *
 * MANDATORY — a coach cannot read a board for a group they are not in. That is P1's
 * shape applied sideways: activity counts flow up a line, but a leaderboard is read
 * across one, so "who is in this group" has to be decided by the rules and not by
 * whichever query the client felt like sending.
 *
 * Membership is resolved from the CURRENT user document, never from anything stored
 * on the snapshot — D64's finding, which is why the fixture below never puts a
 * `uplinePath` on a board document for the rule to trust.
