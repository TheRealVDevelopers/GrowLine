/**
 * The boards screen (F13), in a browser, on a phone-sized viewport.
 *
 * ## What this covers that no other test can
 *
 * The seeded organisation has four coaches, which is BELOW the floor at which a
 * board is published (five — see ranking.ts, where the reason is privacy rather than
 * performance). So this is the zero-data case, and every list, board and alert has to
 * teach rather than render an empty box. That state is the one a real pilot club sees
 * on day one, and it is the easiest one to ship broken because it looks fine in a
 * fixture full of data.
 *
 * It also covers the two navigations that carry no JavaScript — week/month and the
 * scope filter are plain links — and the opt-out round trip through its API route.
 *
 * The opt-out is turned back on before the test ends. The emulator is shared state
 * (D44) and a coach left off the boards would silently change what a later run of
 * this file, or anybody else's, is looking at.
