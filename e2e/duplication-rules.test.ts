/**
 * Security Rules tests for `duplicationScores` (F20).
 *
 *   npm run test:rules:duplication
 *
 * House style (e2e/rules.test.ts): real authenticated clients against the emulator
 * with the real rules file, and every check states the rule it defends and why.
 *
 * ## The ones that matter most
 *
 * MANDATORY — nobody can write one. A duplication reading is the output of a read
 * across the entire organisation, and it is the single figure in these modules that
 * an individual has an obvious motive to fabricate. A client-writable score is a
 * coach typing 100 into their own line's report card.
 *
 * MANDATORY — a coach can read their OWN reading and nobody else's. Not a peer, not
 * their upline, not their downline. Activity counts do flow up a line (P1), so an
 * upline reading this would not be a privacy breach in itself — the grant is
 * withheld because the screen that would use it does not exist, and because the
 * moment it is written the ancestry test has to be resolved live against the current
 * tree (D64) rather than against anything stored here.
 *
 * MANDATORY — nothing stored ON a reading can grant access to it. The last check
 * below plants an ancestry array on a document and confirms the rule ignores it
 * completely. That is D64 as a property of the database: authorization never reads a
 * write-time snapshot of the tree, and no future field on this document can quietly
 * become one.
