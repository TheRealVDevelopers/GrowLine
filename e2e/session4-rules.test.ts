/**
 * Security Rules tests for `voiceLogs` and `silenceAlerts` (session 4).
 *
 *   npm run test:rules:session4
 *
 * House style (e2e/rules.test.ts): real authenticated clients against the emulator with
 * the real rules file, and every check states the rule it defends and why.
 *
 * ## The ones that matter most
 *
 * MANDATORY — no upline can read a downline's voice note, at any depth, with the
 * privacy toggle ON or OFF. This is the strictest rule in the file and it is not the
 * same rule as the one guarding `prospects`. A voice note is unstructured speech: a
 * coach dictating on a road says "met Ramesh on the walk, he's coming Tuesday, his
 * number is…", and no product decision can stop them. So the raw material P1 protects
 * is protected harder than the structured records it was written for — `shareProspects`
 * opens prospect documents to an upline and opens nothing here.
 *
 * MANDATORY — nobody can write one, and in particular nobody can set `status`. That
 * field is the server's statement that a `dailyLogs` document exists, and it is what the
 * purge job reads to decide what to delete. A client that could write it could mark its
 * own recordings counted and have them kept, or mark somebody else's and have the audio
 * dropped.
 *
 * MANDATORY — `silenceAlerts` is readable by nobody at all, including the upline the
 * row was written for. It is the one artifact in these modules whose subject is not its
 * reader: a durable, queryable record of when the app reported a named coach as quiet.
 * Nothing in the browser reads it, and a coach discovering they can query it is the
 * exact failure the notification copy was written to avoid, made inspectable.
