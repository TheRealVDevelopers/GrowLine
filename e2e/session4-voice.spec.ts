/**
 * The voice note, driven with a microphone (session 4, feature 1).
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate file
 *
 * Playwright refuses `test.use({ launchOptions })` inside a describe block — it forces a
 * new worker — so the flags that give Chromium a fake audio device have to be top-level.
 * The rest of session 4 lives in `session4.spec.ts` and deliberately runs WITHOUT a
 * device, because the refused-microphone path is its own test and needs a browser that
 * genuinely has no mic.
 *
 * `executablePath` is resolved here the same way `playwright.config.ts` resolves it,
 * because a top-level `test.use({ launchOptions })` REPLACES the object rather than
 * merging into it — dropping the container's Chromium path and leaving Playwright with
 * nothing to launch. Duplicated deliberately and narrowly; the config is not this
 * branch's to edit.
