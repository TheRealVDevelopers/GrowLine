/**
 * The email + password door (D82), driven through the real UI the way
 * `signup.spec.ts` drives the phone one.
 *
 * Email is the step a visitor lands on because production SMS is not switched on
 * yet — which makes this, for now, the way a real coach actually gets in. The parts
 * only a browser can prove: Firebase email auth, the ID-token exchange deciding
 * new-vs-existing, the profile step collecting the number the credential no longer
 * carries, and that number becoming the coach's contact identity.
 */

/**
 * A fixed identity, on purpose. The Auth emulator accepts
 * `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` with no console setup, and `npm run e2e:reset`
 * wipes both emulators between runs, so a constant address never collides with a
 * previous run's account. The phone number stays clear of the seeded fixtures
 * (9000000001–4) — complete-signup refuses a number that already has an account,
 * and colliding with Asha would turn that guard into a false failure here.
 *
 * The suite runs one worker in file order: the first test creates the account the
 * later ones sign into.
