/**
 * Qualifications (F14) in a browser, on a phone-sized viewport.
 *
 * ## What this covers that no other test can
 *
 * The round trip. A unit test can prove the scoring is honest and a rules test can
 * prove the rows are unreadable, but neither can show that an upline announcing a
 * qualification produces a working tracker on a downline's phone — which is the whole
 * feature, and which depends on the create route evaluating synchronously rather than
 * leaving an empty frame until a scheduler that is not deployed happens to run.
 *
 * It also covers the zero-data state on every surface, because that is what a pilot
 * club sees on day one and it is the easiest state to ship broken: it looks fine in a
 * fixture full of data. The seeded organisation has four coaches, nobody has met a
 * condition, and every card here has to teach instead of rendering an empty box.
 *
 * ## Shared emulator (D44)
 *
 * The title carries a per-run suffix, because the document id is deterministic on
 * (creator, title, deadline) — deliberately, so a double-tapped button cannot create
 * twins — and a fixed title would make the second run of this file fail on its own
 * first run's data. There is no delete route to clean up with; `npm run e2e:reset`
 * is the reset.
