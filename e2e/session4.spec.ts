/**
 * Session 4 in a browser: the call list, the voice-note screen, and the two scheduled
 * endpoints. Phone-sized viewport, real emulators, the seeded organisation.
 *
 * ## What this covers that no other test can
 *
 * The unit tests prove the ranking and the parser; the rules tests prove who may read a
 * recording. Neither can tell you that a coach opening these screens is shown something
 * they can act on, or that the first-day state teaches instead of rendering an empty
 * frame — the easiest thing in this whole branch to ship broken, because it looks fine
 * in a fixture full of data.
 *
 * ## Nothing here mutates the emulator
 *
 * The seeded organisation already contains all three call-list states, one per coach:
 * Asha has a missed promise and an undated contact, Bhavana's only prospect has joined,
 * and Root has captured nobody. So every state is reachable read-only, and the shared
 * emulator (D44) is left exactly as it was found.
