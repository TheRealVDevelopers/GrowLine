/**
 * Security Rules tests for the qualification collections (F14).
 *
 *   npm run test:rules:quals
 *
 * House style (e2e/rules.test.ts): real authenticated clients against the emulator
 * with the real rules file, and every check states the rule it defends and why.
 *
 * ## The ones that matter most
 *
 * MANDATORY — `qualificationProgress` is unreadable by everybody. It holds the
 * audience size, every participant's numbers and every participant's shortfall.
 * The qualifier list this feature renders shows QUALIFIED coaches by name and the
 * one-condition-away group as a count, and that distinction is only a guarantee if
 * the underlying rows cannot be fetched. Denied to the creator too, and to the coach
 * a row is about: a grant with an exception is a grant somebody widens.
 *
 * MANDATORY — a coach outside the creator's line cannot read the qualification at
 * all. P1's shape: activity flows up a line, and a qualification runs down one, so
 * "who is in this" has to be decided by the rules rather than by whichever query a
 * client felt like sending.
 *
 * MANDATORY — nothing here is client-writable. A writable progress row is a coach
 * marking themselves qualified, which would be the entire feature handed away.
 *
 * Membership is resolved from the CURRENT user document, never from anything stored
 * on the qualification — D64 — which is why no fixture below puts an audience list or
 * a `uplinePath` on a qualification for a rule to trust.
