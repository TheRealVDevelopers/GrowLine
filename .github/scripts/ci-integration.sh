#   next start -> e2e           the production bundle, not `next dev`, because that is

#
# `e2e:reset` rather than a bare `migrate:firestore`, even though CI always starts from
# an empty emulator and the reset is a no-op there. The point is that this script then
# runs correctly on a developer's machine too, against emulators that have been up all
# afternoon accumulating test data — and a CI script you cannot rehearse locally is one
# whose failures you can only debug by pushing. Verified: without the reset it fails on
# a used emulator with a migrate MISMATCH, which is precisely the D44 trap.

# `e2e:reset` now re-seeds first, so the explicit `db:seed` that used to be here is gone
# rather than duplicated. That ordering is the point: SQLite is the source the migration
# reads, its fixture dates are relative to the moment it is written, and re-migrating
# without re-seeding replays dates that have aged. A fixture meaning "promised a call
# yesterday" becomes "2 days late" overnight and the call-list spec fails describing the
# app as broken. This bit CI's own ordering into existence once (bug #12) and bit a
# developer again on 2026-08-14 (bug #18) — the second time because the reset step LOOKS
# like it covers seeding and did not.
